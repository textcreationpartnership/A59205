         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt contagious diſeaſes, next to the Peſtilence, and Leproſy of Arabians, the French Pox doth challenge the firſt place; but it is called by ſeveral names:
<note place="margin">The Names of the french diſeaſe;</note> the moſt common name is the French Pox, which was therefore impoſed, becauſe it firſt of al in Europe appeared amongſt the French. For in the yeare of our Lord 1493. and 1494. When <hi>Charls</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>France,</hi> waried with King <hi>Alphonſus</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> this diſeaſe firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and began to rage in the Camps of the French, and therefore by the <hi>Italians</hi> was firſt of al named the French diſeaſe. For whereas <hi>Antonius Benivenius de abdit. morb. cauſ. cap.</hi> 1. relates that it happened in the year of our Lord 1496. that doubtleſs is thus to be underſtood, That now this diſeaſe did no longer contain it ſelf in <hi>Italy,</hi> but as he ſpeaks, had almoſt ſpread over al Europe, and began to diffuſe it ſelf abroad through the reſt of its provinces; for al other Authors agree in this, that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe did firſt of al appeare at the foreſaid time in the French Camp at <hi>Naples,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The French Diſeaſe. The Italian. The Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan. The Spaniſh The Indian.</note> and there was called the French diſeaſe. But the French that they may remove this diſgrace from themſelves, and retort the injury upon the Italian, cal it the Italian, and Neapolitan diſeaſe, becauſe it was firſt known in <hi>Italy</hi> at <hi>Naples.</hi> Others becauſe it was brought by the Spaniards into the Fench Camp, cal it the Spaniſh diſeaſe, and others the Indian, for the writers of the Indies do report that in that part of <hi>America,</hi> whoſe longitude ends towards the North, and which they cal <hi>Florida,</hi> this diſeaſe many ages ago was epidemical; and they write that it did generally invade, and ſuddenly ſeize on many without any manifeſt cauſe, without contagion, and eſpecially if any one had copulation with a woman in the time of her Courſes. <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> cals it Syphilis, ſome the gout of the privicies,
<note place="margin">Syphilis; Pudenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra. The great Pox. The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſeawſes Whether it be a new Diſeaſe.</note> ſome the great Pox, becauſe puſtles and ſwellings do every where break forth like thoſe of the ſmal Pox. Moſt men now adays without any injury or diſgrace to any Nation, do cal it the Veneral diſeaſe, becauſe it is chiefly contracted by a contagion from Venery, and lying with unwholſome bodies.</p>
               <p>But Authors are wont here to make this Quaerie, Whether that diſeawſe ſprung up at <hi>Naples</hi> about the yeare 1494. were a new diſeaſe, or whether it were known to the Ancients? <hi>Franciſcus Valleſius.</hi> 1. <hi>Epidem. com.</hi> 1. And <hi>Hieron Ruſnerus de Scorbuto exercit.</hi> 1. and the ſome other moderns, are of opinion this diſeaſe was unknown to the ancients, and they think that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did not ſhadow it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37365:4"/>out by his pencil, but ſet it forth to the life in 3 Epid. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. (they are the words of <hi>Reuſner</hi>) whenas he reckons up there divers ſymptomes, which are ſeen in the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſe; as impoſthumations and ſuppurations of the fleſh, the lying bare of the nerves and bones, and great fallings forth, fluxions collected not like unto matter, but far worſe, a baldneſs of the head and chin, with and without a Feaver, St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies fire with ſmal Ulcers and inflamation, filthy and putrid fluxes, pains of the limbs, ſwellings about the jaws, inflamations of the tongue, impoſtumations, about the teeth, ſtammering, corrupt, and perplext ſpeech, enterings into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, burning Feavers, and which is worſt of al, ulcers about the pubes and privities.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in that place never ſo much as dream'd of the Veneral diſeaſe, but deſcribes a moſt grievous peſtilence, according to the judgment of <hi>Galen</hi> and al interpreters, and the evidence of the Hiſtory it ſelf witneſſing the ſame. For that diſeaſe for the moſt part invaded with a Feaver, which is not ſo in the Veneral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and was epidemical, whenas the Veneral diſeaſe is diſſeminated only by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, and no other way, and the method of curing that diſeaſe was far different from the cure of the veneral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dodoneus</hi> alſo hath obſerv'd upon the alleaged place of <hi>Benivenius,</hi> that a long time agoe ſome men have contracted ſome hurts from uncleane and filthy women, as <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lielmus Salicetus, Gordonius,</hi> and <hi>Valleſcus de Taranta,</hi> do teſtify, the laſt of which lived in the year 1418. but <hi>Salicetus</hi> flouriſht in the yeare 1270. <hi>Gordonius</hi> in the time between them both. Nay holy writ doth teſtefy that he that followeth harlots, ſhal have wormes and moths for his reward: but I do not think that thoſe diſeaſes were the ſame with the Veneral diſeaſe of this time which firſt of al ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the aforeſaid time in <hi>Italy</hi> in the Camp of the French. Therefore though <hi>Paracelſus, lib. de tumorib. et ulcer. morb. Gal. cap.</hi> 3. Writes that this hapned in the yeare 1478.
<note place="margin">The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Veneral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> and <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de cauſa luis Gal. cap.</hi> 3. In the yeare 1480. yet he differs from the relations of al others, ſince al agree in this, that this diſeaſe was not known in Europe, before the yeare of our Lord 1493. although it were endemious in the weſt <hi>Indies</hi> a long while before, and was brought by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards out of <hi>India</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi> For when <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus</hi> in the yeare 1492. in the month of <hi>September</hi> undertook his firſt voyage into the weſt Indies, and ſpent almoſt two years in that expedition, he returned into <hi>Spain</hi> in the yeare 1494. whoſe Souldiers being infected with that diſeaſe in <hi>India,</hi> and afterwards ſerving in the <hi>Italian</hi> expedition, did ſow amongſt them this diſeaſe. For as <hi>Gabriel Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopius</hi> writes of this buſineſs <hi>de morb. Gal. lib.</hi> 1. (Who reports his Father was in that warre) whenas the Spaniards by reaſon of the deareneſs of proviſin did drive out the unſerviceable multitude, the French did privately entertain their harlots, being allured by their beauty, and ſo infected with their contagion contracted this diſeaſe, which afterwards was firſt of al ſpred through their camps, &amp; hence through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Europe.</p>
               <p>Yet in ſome Countries it hath and doth yet ſpred more frequently, in others 'tis more rare, to enquire into the cauſe whereof, it being a thing hateful we ſhal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare; yet this I think is certain, that there are fewer ſick of this diſeaſe in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> than in ſome other Countries. <hi>Gabriel Fallopius</hi> makes mention <hi>de morb. Gal. cap.</hi> 76. Of <hi>Jacob Carpus,</hi> who was the firſt almoſt that uſed the way of cure by unction of Quickſilver, who by this cure alone grew ſo rich, that he left befides Silver, 40000. Golden
<note n="*" place="margin">A Coin.</note> Scutatces. And <hi>Capivaccius</hi> reports in <hi>tractat: de lue Vener. cap.</hi> 12. In fine, that he hath gotten by the cure of the French Pox only above 18000 Crowns of Gold. And <hi>L.

But I confeſs ingeniouſly, that within theſe 34 yeares which I have practiſed at <hi>Witeberge,</hi> and by Gods bleſſing I do it not without profit, that I have not gained by the cure of this diſeaſe ſo many
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37365:4"/>Crownes, as <hi>Capivaccius</hi> hath got thouſands of them, by reaſon of the fewneſs of them that are ſick of this diſeaſe in this place.</p>
               <p>Yet others differ concerning its original, and think that this diſeaſe was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſeminated by contagion from the Spaniards, but think it was contracted by the fault of the Ayr, as epidemick diſeaſes are; when as many every where in diverſe countries began to be ſick of this diſeaſe without any contagion; of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful virulent matter, and the ſcales being caſt, the fleſh appeared more dark and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what livid. Some having white ſcales taken off there remained ſomwhat like unto a skar, from which blood ſometimes flowing, did ſhew the difficulty of the cure, and it repreſented the likeneſs of a dry ſcabb, a diſeaſe worſe than al the reſt. For though it did corrode leſs, yet for ſpreading it was worſe than the reſt, and was diffuſed into divers places. Beſides thoſe external puſtles there did riſe others in internal places, as in the mouth, jawes, noſe, and the obſcene parts, which turned to malignant and creeping ulcers which eat away the parts under them, and in ſome eat up the Noſe, in others the lipps, in others conſumed the Uvula, and perforated the palate, which cauſed their voice to be hoarſe; neither did this evil ſpare the bones, but cauſed rottenneſs in them, whence ſome had their skul, others other bones ful of holes. Neither did thoſe puſtles and ſigns of the diſeaſe appear only in the external parts obvious to the eye, but it was obſerved in ſome, that thoſe puſtles &amp; filthy ulcers had poſſeſt their very bowels. They that had this evil about their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts, had vitious diſtillations, which did ſometimes eat their palate, ſomtimes the jaws and conſills, in ſome their noſe, and in others their eyes. Furthermore for the moſt part certain gummoſities grew on their limbs in great deformity. For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes they were prominent the bigneſs of an egg, oftentimes the ſize of a Loare, which being opened, there appeared a white mucilagmous mucous: that tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous callus, happened moſt of al in the Arms and Thighs, in ſome it was exulcerated, ſomtimes it continued whole until their death. There came alſo cruel pains with exceeding torment, which were exaſperated towards night: but thoſe pains did ſhew themſelves about that part of the bones where is no fleſh in the Leggs, ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-blade, about the collar-bone, in the ſhoulders, head, about the forehead and temples, ſomtimes alſo in the breaſt bone, but not in the very joints, but about the muſcles and nerves. In which caſe notwithſtanding there was great variety. For ſome had pains without puſtles, ſome puſtles without pain, the greateſt part was affected with both, and truly thoſe pains ſomtimes went before the puſtles,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37365:5"/>ſomtimes followed, and ſometimes roſe together with them: in the interim al parts languiſhed, the body pined away, the appetite was dejected, watchings, ſadneſs, and continual anger, and deſire of repoſe poſſeſt them; ſometimes a ſmal Feavor accompanied them, but ſeldome: their blood, if a Vein were opened, was mucous, and corrupt, their urine thick, fat, and ſomwhat red without a Feavor, they went hardly to ſtool, and the excrements were mucous and dry. The ſhedding of the Hait is frequent in this Diſeaſe, eſpecially in the Head, about the Temples, and the hinder part, alſo of the eybrows, and of the beard in men; oftentimes alſo Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes break forth in the groin, therefore called Veneral and Gallical, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vaniſh again, ſomtimes grow hard, ſomtimes ſuppurate; there riſe alſo in the privities of Women knobs, and in men in their Arie-hole, beſides ſomtimes there happen chops and clefts in the hands and feet, and the thick Skin in the palme of the hands departs from the skin under it; ſometimes alſo the nails fal off: At laſt there happens ſometimes, that in men a virulent matter flowes through their yard, in women through their privities, which flux of virulent matter is commonly called the Gallical or virulent running of the reins, although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not feed, by which flux of the y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Truly I think this is not doubted, that 'tis a Contagious, Malignant and Venenate Affect; neither doth it ſeem to want any great pains to prove it, for it appears ſufficiently by this, that in ſo ſmal a quantity of matter, by which this Diſeaſe is contracted by conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, there is ſo great force and power of action, as no firſt quality, or the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament made up of the firſt qualities can have; and the variety of Diſeaſes and Symptomes in this evill is ſo great, that it cannot be reduced to any manifeſt cauſe; therefore as in peſtilent conſtitutions, ſuch as that A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uppores this as the ground of his opinion, viz that the French Diſeaſe ought not to be defined by a quality, but rather by the name of a body, for this reaſon, becauſe it paſſeth from one body to another, which is the propriety of bodies not of qualities, and becauſe it toucheth other bodies, for none but bodies can touch, and be cough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, no manifeſt one, as he proves rightly by many Arguments; but that it is no occult quality he brings no ſpecial Argument, but repeats the general one, becauſe 'tis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from place to place, and toucheth other bodies.</p>
               <p>This preſuppoſed, afterwards Chap. 30. he affirmes the Veneral virulency to be ſomwhat corporeal internal, and truly a ſpirit or a vapor, for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis carried, commuicated, and participated in a very ſhort ſpace of time.

                  </gap> them &amp; turn them to its own likeneſs: but that this evil conſiſts in a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſubſtance, he further proves, becauſe ſome are infected not only by the act of Venery, but alſo by a Kiſs, or the uſe of garments: next of al, becauſe ſome have felt no other hurt from this evil, than only the falling of their hair, becauſe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oots of the hairs were gnawed off by the acrid vapors. Thirdly, becauſe ſome only by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement exerciſe have diſcuſſed this virulency. Yet he denies that vapor or ſpirit to be properly an excrement, Chap. 20. whenas that is properly an excrement, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds from nouriſhment, &amp; which is caſt off from another: although he grants there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37365:6"/>that is commonly called an excrement, whatſoever is ſuperfluous in the body, whether it be a ſpirit, or humor, or ſome other ſolid body, whether it be uſual, or unuſual, whether according to nature or preternatural; furthermore he holds this vapor to be wandring, thin, and viſcid, Chap. 21. and to be raiſed from a ſpirituous, humorous, ſolid ſubſtance: but he proves Chap. 22. by many Arguments that this vapor is contrary and preternatural by its whole ſubſtance, of which we ſhal ſpeak hereafter; and at laſt Chap. 27. he deſines the Veneral vitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that it is a vapor by its whol ſubſtance inimicous to the natural faculty, working by degrees. And that he might unfold his mind more clearly, and not leave the Reader doubtful, to what kind of things preternatural this vitulency ought to be referred, when as he had ſaid before, that it was neither the Diſeaſe, nor the cauſe, nor the Symptome, yet it primarily hurt the actions; at length Chap. 28. he holds that 'tis an externall error, and he endeavors to prove it by this Sylogiſme, whatſoever doth primarily hurt the operation, and is not of the conſtitution of the body, is an external error, but the Veneral virulency doth primarily hurt the operation, and is not of the conſtitution of the body, therefore 'tis an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal error.</p>
               <p>Some that they may briefly quit themſelves, and hold with al men, ſay that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is a heap of al evils, Diſeaſes and ſymptomes.</p>

<note place="margin">The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſe depends on an occult quality.</note> firſt of al 'tis alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved, and ſhal be proved more at large hereafter, that they are in the right, who do here admit of an occult quality, and a power depending on the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as they commonly ſpeak; neither can they hold any other waies, Since 'tis without doubt, that 'tis a contagious and malignant diſeaſe while it is ſuch.

                  </gap> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes two things, to wit, it alters the body by which it is received and changeth it to its owne ſimilitude, and indeed it alters it not by the firſt qualities: as ſhal be ſaid by and by, ſince it is not expeld by the firſt qualities; neither is that change alwaies with putrefaction, whenas putrefaction is not induced but by a long time, but this change is made in a moment as it were; neither is it an aduſtion as <hi>John Baptiſta Montanus,</hi> and ſome others do h old, whenas there is not alwaies a hot &amp; dry diſtemper preſent, neither is it cured by cooling and moiſtening things, and oftentimes there is a fordid putrefaction, in which there is no exuſtion.</p>
               <p>But whereas they hold this malignity is only in that matter ſeated without the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parts,
<note place="margin">'Tis a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> and that there is no ſuch diſeaſe preſent, in this they erre very much. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we willingly grant, that that contagious inquination, ſent forth from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy infected with the veneral diſeaſe, may adhere to the garments; neither do we deny this, that the humors in our body may be tainted with the ſame, yet in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim it doth ſcarce follow, that the living parts remain free and found; for as in a purrid feaver, though the humors and ſpirits do firſt grow not by the feaveriſh heat, yet afterwards the living parts are ſeized on by the ſame diſtemper, ſo though the humors in the Veneral diſeaſe are firſt infected by that occult malignity, yet there is no cauſe why the ſame fault may not be communicated to the living parts.</p>
               <p>But though ſome do acknowledg that this cauſe cannot be idle,
<note place="margin">Not hot and dry.</note> yet whenas they know nothing beyond the manifeſt and firſt qualities, they endeavour to reduce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the effects of the veneral virulency to manifeſt cauſes. <hi>John Baptiſta Montanus</hi> as was ſaid even now, thinks the eſſence of this evil conſiſts in a hot and dry diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but the cure tels otherwiſe, whenas 'tis cured by hot and dry Medicines, as by the Decoction of Guajacum and the like: beſides, becauſe there is a great putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the Humors, which doth not proceed from a hot and dry diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

                  <hi>Nicolaus Maſſa de Morb. Galli. Cap.</hi> 5.
<note place="margin">Not cold and dry.</note> ſaith it is a coldneſs of the Liver, declining to a little drineſs with an occult quality: but as concerning the occult quality he writes truly, but that it is no cold diſtemper, the effect doth teach us, as the Ulcers, rottenneſs of the bones, and the like; and what other diſtemper ſoever they alleage. Yet they produce nothing agreeable to the Diſeaſes and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37365:6"/>Symptomes, which appear in this Diſeaſe, nor to the Cure.</p>
               <p>Therefore when as the action of the veneral virulency can be referred to no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt quality. We may wel ſay that by that is induced an occult quality:
<note place="margin">But occult.</note> For firſt of al every efficient cauſe is ſaid to be a cauſe from the nature of its efficiency, and therefore this malignant quality doth not only alter and change the humors, but alſo the living parts into its likeneſs: again, though the morbifick cauſe be taken away, and this diſeaſe ſeem now to be overcome, yet unleſs that malignant diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be deſtroyed the man recovers not his perfect health. For it hath been obſerved that the Veneral Diſeaſe hath ſomtimes grown freſh after thirty years paſt, which doubtleſs happened not becauſe the Vitious Humors lay ſo long hid in the body (for theſe would have ſooner diſcovered themſelves by their ſigns) but becauſe that malignant diſpoſition impreſt on the body was actually there, which afterwards, by degrees produced vitious humors, and corrupted, and ſo broke forth into act; and <hi>Trincavellius, Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>de curand. rat. particul. affect. cap.</hi> 11. reports, that a certain Woman brought forth a Child ſick of the French Diſeaſe, and every whereful of cruſty Ulcers, whenas ſhe her ſelf never had any ſign of that Diſeaſe contracted, but was alwaies wholly wel, and on the contrary it may happen, that one may have a French Ulcer, which yet, when that Malignity is diſtroyed, is no longer rightly ſaid to be Gallical, but is cured by vulgar Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as other Ulcers.</p>
               <p>Al which being thus, we conceive the the Veneral Diſeaſe, doth not only exiſt in the Humors, but alſo in the living parts, and that it doth conſiſt not only in the change of the firſt qualities, but alſo there is an occult malignant quality im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on the parts, and therefore the veneral Diſeaſe is to be referred to diſeaſes, and thoſe of occult qualities. Which are called by <hi>Fernelius</hi> diſeaſes of the whol ſubſtance, but not on every part rightly explained, as we have ſaid before, the which if <hi>Capivaccius,</hi> and <hi>Saxonia</hi> had known, the one would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined this evil by the excrement, nor the other by the cauſe.
<note place="margin">An exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Aurelius Minadous opinion.</note> if the ſame alſo had been known to <hi>Aurelius Minadous,</hi> he would not have endeavoured to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this evil was no Diſeaſe, but an external error. For whereas he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to prove that the veneral Diſeaſe is not a Diſeaſe of the ſimilar parts, becauſe it is not a diſtemper, nor an evil compoſition, nor a ſolution of unity, in this proof he labors to no purpoſe, for al this we willingly grant; but this he ought to prove, that there is no other kind of Diſeaſe in the ſimilar parts beſides the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the firſt qualities; but that there are ſuch diſeaſes, which <hi>Fernelius</hi> calls of the whol ſubſtance, we more rightly, of occult qualities, is ſufficiently proved above, <hi>part</hi> 1. and this very Diſeaſe, as all other venenate Diſeaſes do ſhew, that it can be referred to no other kind than to malignant qualities; &amp; this follows from <hi>Minadous</hi> his own ſuppoſition, and confeſſion, which he hath <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. where he writes, that the Veneral virulency hath power not only to infect al Humors, but al parts of the body, and to corrupt and convert them to its own ſimilitude. The ſame <hi>Minadous</hi> if he had known theſe Diſeaſes, had not taken ſo much pains, to what kind of preternatural things the veneral virulency ought to be referred. For firſt of al there was no need of excluding from the number of cauſes, thoſe vitious Humors, which are found in the bodies ſick of the veneral Diſeaſe, and have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to alter and change the Humors themſelves and parts of the body. For whereas he ſaith, that is properly the cauſe, between which and the action hurt the diſeaſe doth interceed, that is true of the next cauſe, but the antecedent cauſes alſo may do hurt, as they have the Nature of a vitious object, and external Error: and in this very Diſeaſe whiles the virulent Humors do imprint a malignant qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity on he parts, between them and the action hurt that Malignant diſpoſition and occult quality doth intercede. Therefore whereas he thinks that Humor or venenate vapour in the veneral diſeaſe, doth imediately hurt the action, 'tis falſe, unleſs that humor have the nature of an external error. For al hurt actions in the Veneral diſeaſe do happen, whiles between them and the humor, or malignant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37365:7"/>vapor, a midling diſeafe doth intercede, to wit, that of occult qualities.</p>
               <p>But whereas he denies the Veneral virulency to be a quality,
<note place="margin">The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſe is not a Body.</note> and holds it to be a body, firſt of al he confounds the cauſe and the diſeaſe, next of al he doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between the quality and its ſubject. For whiles we ſay the Veneral evil, we underſtand either the diſeaſe it ſelf, or its cauſe: if the diſeaſe, that is a quality, as al diſeaſes are, to wit a preternatural diſpoſition of the parts, and indeed an occult and malignant quality: but if the veneral evil be taken for the cauſe, either w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> without, being communicated doth induce this diſeaſe; or which is in the body, which raiſeth divers diſeaſes and ſymptomes, and can infect others, we grant that cauſe may be called a body. But we muſt take notice, that thoſe humors or vapors are not ſaid to be cauſes, as they are bodies, but as they have an occult and malignant quality, which <hi>Minadous</hi> himſelf cannot deny, while <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. he writes, That that vapor or ſpirit, which he cals the veneral virulency, is endewed with an occult quality and vertue, depending on its whole ſubſtance, by which it is able not only to infect any humors of the body, but al its parts, and to corrupt and convert them to its own ſimilitude. For what ſimilitude is that I pray, to which the Veneral virulency converts not only the humors, but alſo the parts of the body, unleſs it be that occult quality with which that vapor is endewed?</p>
               <p>Whereas laſt of al, <hi>Cap.</hi> 38. he refers the Veneral virulency to external error, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it primarily hurts the operation, and is not of the conſtitution of the body. But before denied it to be either the diſeaſe, or cauſe of the diſeaſe, or ſymptome, in vain doth he multiply things, preternatural; for there are not more preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, than the diſeaſe, cauſe, and ſymptome; and the Veneral virulency, as he deſcribes it, doth wholy belong to the cauſes two manner of waies, for either it induceth the like diſpoſition into the parts of the body, or it raiſeth other diſeaſes while it eats and exulcerates the parts. But whenas he ſaith the Veneral diſeaſe taken for the cauſe,
<note place="margin">Whether it be a Vapor or a ſpirit.</note> is a vapor or a ſpirit, that is rightly to be underſtood; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it can no way be denied, that it is a humor alſo, whenas in copulation 'tis rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed againſt the body, and ſticks in the cloaths: yet ſuch is its nature, as 'tis alſo of other contagious humors, that though it be reſolved into vapors and the leaſt bodies, yet every one of them contains its whole eſſence, and hath power to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect others: and this thing may be declared by musk, caſtor, and the like. For thoſe things, though they be bodies, and humorous too, yet are ſuch, that though they be reſolved into the leaſt bodies, nevertheleſs they retain their ful ſtrength. After the ſame manner it is in the Veneral diſeaſe, and other contagious diſeaſes, in which though the malignant and contagious humor, he reſolved into the leaſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet every one of them obtaines the ſame eſſence, and vertue, and power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect others. But whereas he thinks that humor and vapor is not to be called the cauſe, but an external error, in that alſo he is miſtaken: for an external error be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto the cauſes, from whence the Symptomes ariſing from an external error, are called the ſymptomes of the cauſe; where this alſo is to be obſerved, that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians do not vouchſafe the name of the cauſe to the next cauſe only, but alſo to the antecedent, which do not yet effect the diſeaſe: therefore there is bad nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by reaſon of vitious humors, although they have not yet imprinted a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and vitious diſpoſition on the parts: but whereas he denies the Veneral viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, conſidered as a vapor to be the cauſe, becauſe it hurts the actions not by the mediation of a diſeaſe, but next of al, and imediately, he preſuppoſeth that which is not yet granted, and ſo begs the queſtion: for this ſpirit or vapor hurts the very conſtitution of the ſimilar part, and imprinteth on it a malignant quality; the which he himſelf cannot deny, whiles <hi>Cap.</hi> 23. he holds, that by this diſeaſe of venery many actions are hurt, but not al in al people; but the hurt of the natural faculty is common to al, and that there is none, that is poſſeſt with this diſeaſe who is not troubled with ſome fault in his natural actions, and hence proceeds al that filth of excrements, and the gummoſities ariſing from thence, tumors, puſtles,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37365:7"/>pains, running of the reins, ulcers, rottenneſs, and ſuch like evils; and that the Veneral virulency hath a peculiar enmity, and diſcord with the natural faculty, and is inimicous to it by its whol kind, that is, by its form, by its ſpecifick faculty, by its whole ſubſtance, and occult propriety: but he further deſcribes the enmity againſt the natural faculty, that it is by its nature deſtructive to the natural ſpirit, that the Veneral virulency hath unſpeakable qualities, hindering the generation of the natural ſpirits, and thoſe not manifeſt, but occult. But whenas there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a natural action, the ſoul, the temperament, and the innate heat, or the implanted ſpirit, and the influent heat, he further concludes rightly, that the ſoul is not hurt, as that which can no waies ſuffer, nor the manifeſt temperament, as was proved hitherto, but chiefly the implanted ſpirit or the innate heat: al which whenas they are ſo rightly ſpoke, and the Veneral virulency is an enemy to the implanted ſpirit, and truely not by manifeſt qualities, but by its form, by its ſpecifick fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, by an occult propriety, by which it indeavours to change not only the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, but alſo the living parts, and the implanted heat in them into its own ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, certainly the like malignant quality, is induced into the parts: which vitious &amp; malignant quality, what other thing I pray is it, than an occult &amp; malignant diſeaſe?</p>
               <p>Al which being thus, we rightly conclude,
<note place="margin">The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil is an occult &amp; venenate Diſeaſe.</note> the Veneral evil is an occult and venenate diſeaſe; for it is induced by cauſes of that kind, and immediately exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth ſuch effects which cannot be referred to any manifeſt diſtemper, but onely to an occult quality; neither is it cured by medicines that work by manifeſt qualities, &amp; correct known diſtempers, but by proper and ſpecificks, which al Phyſitians at this day, and eſpecially thoſe who lived at the beginning of this diſeaſe have reſtified, and to their own and patients damage have found it true. For when they followed the common way of cure, and could do no good for the cure of this diſeaſe, they began to be deſpiſed by many, til the Spaniſh Phyſitians ſhewed them medicaments brought out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and bold Chyrurgeons ventered upon Quick-Silver.</p>
               <p>But that al this may be made clearer,
<note place="margin">What is the ſubject of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſeaſe.</note> we muſt enquire what is the ſubject to this diſeaſe, concerning which phyſitians do differ. Some have thought the privities are firſt inſected: for by theſe parts for the moſt part, this evil is contracted by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure copulation, and the footſteps of this diſeaſe, unleſs it be perfectly cured, do chiefly appear about the privities; the but is eaſily excoriated in venery, the fleſh oftentimes remaines callous for a long time, with a running of the reines, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of buboes in the groin. But though it cannot be denied, that oftentimes the original of this evil is from the privities, and doth chiefly diſcover it ſelf in that place. Yet that doth not happen alwaies,
<note place="margin">Not the Priveties.</note> but the ſame diſeaſe may be contracted by kiſſing, ſweat, embraces, veſtures, nay infants alſo may be infected by the milk they ſuck from their nurſe, &amp; they that are infected after this manner, have not this diſeaſe appearing in their privities.</p>
               <p>Some, as <hi>Leonicenus</hi> do hold, ſay that the skin is the ſubject of this evil, as in the ſcab, tetter, and the like affects: but the skin alone is not alwaies affected, but other parts alſo, the privities, the jawes, the bones which become rotten,
<note place="margin">Not the skin.</note> nay ſometimes alſo the internal parts. <hi>Hercules Saxonia de lue Vener. Cap.</hi> 3. maintains a threefold ſubject; one in the beginning; another in the middle; another in the diſeaſe confirmed: in the beginning he holds that the natural ſpirit is affected or the vaporous part of the maſs of blood, then the juyces and excrementitious humors, at laſt the alimentary humors, but in proceſs of the diſeaſe, aduſt humors; and the parts affected are the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach &amp; liver, &amp; thence chylification &amp; ſangification are hurt; but when the evil is old, flegmatick humors are the ſubject of it, &amp; the parts affected are ſimelar, bones, nerves, membranous bodies: but we willingly grant, that as the diſeaſe is new, or old, ſo and alſo ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer parts are poſſeſt and corrupted; as we deny not this neither, that the excrementitious humors are eaſier corrupted than the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, whenas nature doth alwaies more defend the profitable humors, than the excrementitious, into which without any difference this evil doth eaſily almoſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it ſelf, but indeed the queſtion is not here, what may be infected by that viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; but this is the Querie, what is the ſubject of this diſeaſe, which we have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37365:8"/>demonſtrated to be; for as in putrid feavers the ſpirits and humors wax hot, yet are not the ſubject of the feaver; ſo alſo though a malignant quality from the Veneral virulency be imprinted on the humors; yet they are not the ſubject of the diſeaſe, but only the living parts, and which of them is the ſubject of this diſeaſe is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: and whiles that he ſomtimes holds the Liver and ſtomach, ſometimes the ſimilar parts to be the ſubject of this diſeaſe, in that he is wavering, for whether the diſeaſe be new or old, the ſubject is the ſame.</p>
               <p>There were ſome others alſo,
<note place="margin">Not the ſpermatical parts.</note> who held thoſe parts we cal ſpermatical, the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and membranous, were the ſubject of this diſeaſe; but not only the membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and nervous parts, but alſo the fleſhy parts are affected in this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Others hold the Liver to be the chiefe ſubject of this diſeaſe, and this opinion is moſt conſonant to truth,
<note place="margin">Whether the liver.</note> but when as many other parts are affected, 'tis conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to be explained, as ſhal be ſaid by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurelius Minadous de virul. Vener. Cap.</hi> 34. firſt of al preſuppoſeth this, that there is no peculiar member in our body,
<note place="margin">Whether al the parts.</note> which is alwaies affected in the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral virulency, which is true in its way, whiles ſomtimes this, ſomtimes that part is affected; next of al he holds that this viulency is chiefly an adverſary to the natural actions, or rather to their faculties, which natural power when as it is in al parts the veneral virulency is not an enemy to one part in ſpeice, but to al, in which that power is. In the third place he adds this, That that natural vertue implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the natural parts, doth performe its operations without any influx, and that there is no natural faculty influent, as there is an animal influent; ſecondly he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes them in particular, who hold the Liver to be the firſt and perpetual ſubject of this diſeaſe, for it may come to paſs faith he that one after an impure copulation may preſently ſuffer an exulceration in his privities, whom certainly no body wil deny to be infected with the Veneral diſeaſe, whenas yet in him the Liver is not affected: and the ſame reaſon is for other parts, which are firſt affected by contagion; nay he holds, that one external part being infected, the humors in the body may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without any hurt of the Liver. In the interim he cannot deny this, that this evil doth moſt properly and chiefly appear, when the Liver is affected, when as the operations of the Liver are neceſſary to the whol body. The ſame Author <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. endeavors to prove, that the Liver is not the ſubject of the Veneral diſeaſe, whenas the face ſaith he is the index and trueſt glaſs of the internal affects of the body, yet eſpecially the affects of the Liver doe appear in it; therefore if the Liver were perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affected in the Veneral diſeaſe, alſo the color of the face ſhould alwaies appeare vitious, the which we have found falſe by experience; for we have ſeen both men and women infected with this diſeaſe, who notwithſtanding have had a freſh color in their face, and the evil hath been in their privities: again he thinks, that by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal copulation the privites may firſt of al be affected, and from thence the evil may creep through the veins, and by the ſpirits, to the other parts of the body, and as one part is more apt and diſpoſed than another to receive the infection, ſo ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this, ſomtimes that is infected, but not alwaies the Liver.</p>
               <p>That we may cleare our ſelves of this controverſy, firſt of al we muſt enquire from the actions hurt what part is affected,
<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and what faculty is oppreſt; but though divers actions hurt that part in the veneral diſeaſe, yet al of them cannot bring us to the knowledg of the firſt and proper ſubject. It happens indeed ſomtimes, that there are pains felt in the head about the muſcles and bones, but that is not alwaies. Somtimes alſo the hurt happens in the external and internal ſence, but this alſo is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: ſomtimes putrid vapors are inflamed, and hence a Feaver is raiſed, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a French Feaver, but this alſo happens ſeldom. In like manner 'tis in other diſeaſes and fymptomes. One action is hurt which is common to al that are ſick of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſe, viz. nutrition is corrupted; hence we ſee that in thoſe who are poſſeſt with this diſeaſe, the color of their body is changed and ſulled, and ſometimes turns black, ſomtimes of a lead color, ſomtimes livid. There ariſe every where in their body divers kinds of ſwellings and bunchings out, alſo ulcers, the bones rotten, the hairs fal off, al which proceed from corrupt nutrition. From which we conclude that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37365:8"/>the veneral diſeaſe is primarily an enemy to the natural faculty:
<note place="margin">The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſe is an enemy to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculty.</note> but 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this poyſon is only an enemy to the natural faculty, whenas there are other poyſons, which are inimicous to other faculties: thus the poyſon of the peſtilence and many others are enemies to the heart, cantharides to the bladder, mad night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhade and opium to the animal faculty.</p>
               <p>Whence that we may briefly conclude the buſineſs, this evil indeed may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by one member, yet if it be ſpread into more from that one, that comes to paſs becauſe the Liver is infected: yet becauſe this poyſon hath principally an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the natural faculty, and the fountaine of that, or chiefe ſeat is the Liver, that alſo is primarily infected with this virulency, and through that the reſt of the parts contract this evil. Therefore whereas <hi>Minadous</hi> objecteth, the color of the face is ſometimes freſh, therefore the evil is not yet communicated to the Liver, but ſtil ſticks in the privities which were firſt of al infected, and the force of this virulence is ſometimes greater, ſometimes leſs; from whence alſo 'tis ſometimes ſooner, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times later communicated to the Liver. Beſides, this evil conſiſts not in the firſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but in occult, whence 'tis no wonder, that that malignity may conſiſt in the blood, which to the appearance is good; but al thoſe things wil be yet made clearer by the diſcovery of the cauſes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BUt concerning the cauſes of this diſeaſe, two things are to be explained, the firſt is how at this day the Veneral diſeaſe is contracted; the other is,
<note place="margin">The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſe is contracted only by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.</note> what was its original when it firſt appeared. At this day indeed I think this evil is no otherwiſe contracted, than by contagion, and that 'tis manifeſt that every Veneral pox is not contagious <hi>Hercules Saxonia, lib. de lue Vener. cap.</hi> 3. Holds that every Veneral pox is not contagious, and that which is old and confirmed is for the moſt part leſs contagious, than that which is new, and of a middle age,
<note place="margin">Whether it be alwaies contagious?</note> and that which diſcovers it ſelf by knobs, is not contagious; and he endeavors to prove it, firſt of al by reaſon, becauſe the contagion is placed in a hot and movable excrement, but when nothing breaths forth from the part affected, which can be communicated to another, the diſeaſe then is not contagious, and therefore becauſe in the knobs there is no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement contained, or if it be contained, it is not carried to the genitals, therefore that diſeaſe ſhal not be contagious; next of al by experience, for he writes that a certain noble man of <hi>Padua,</hi> who had uſed Guajacum almoſt twenty times, and was thrice anointed with quickſilver, yet could never be cured, and though he lay with Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins yet he never infected them: and out of <hi>Antonius Muſa</hi> he relates of one, who had a wife poſſeſt with the Veneral diſeaſe about her breaſt, yet he never contracted the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>But here we cannot aſſent to <hi>Saxiona,</hi> but we hold that every Veneral diſeaſe is in its manner contagious; but whereas he objects againſt us experience, it doth not follow, that if one ſick of the Veneral diſeaſe doth not actually infect another, that the diſeaſe it ſelf is not contagious; for that an effect may follow, there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary both an agent, and a diſpoſition required in the patient. Hence we ſee that many do converſe with thoſe ſick of the Plague, and are not infected, yet we muſt not conclude from thence, that that Plague was not contagious: &amp; <hi>Gabriel Fallopius de morb. Galli. Cap.</hi> 22. makes mention of twelve Schollars, that had to do with one whore, yet of al them, three only were infected. And <hi>Saxonia</hi> himſelf affords an anſwer to this argument, while he writes, That this diſeaſe is not contagious if nothing breath forth from the part affected, which may be communicated to another, the which may happen in the knobs and calloſities; or if any thing do breath forth, and be not received by another. Therefore though
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37365:9"/>one have an ulcer in his head, or a knob in his thigh, but the Genital parts be ſound, 'tis not neceſſary he infect her he lyes with. But whereas he teacheth that the inveterate Veneral diſeaſe is leſs contagious, than the new, or middle aged it may in its man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be granted; and from that very thing we may collect, that the Veneral diſeaſe is not only the cauſe, but alſo the diſeaſe. For when as this diſeaſe is communicated by the cauſe or contagion, it may come to paſs, that the cauſe may be for the moſt part taken away, which doubtleſs happned in him who ſo often uſed the decoction of Guajacum, and was thrice anointed; and ſuch men indeed, if the diſeaſe be ſtil upon them, but the corrupt humors being for the moſt part emptied by ſweaters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they are not ſo conragious, as thoſe, who were lately infected with this out of whom thoſe malignant humors have not yet been emptied.</p>
               <p>Therefore we conclude, though for certaine reaſons, thoſe who are ſick of this diſeaſe do not alwaies infect others; yet at this day there is no man taken with this evil, but who hath been infected by contagion from another, and ſo this evil at this day is propagated only by contagion.</p>
               <p>But how,
<note place="margin">The firſt original of the veneral Difeaſe.</note> and from what cauſes this Diſeaſe was raiſed, when it firſt appeared in Europe, Authors are diverſe in their opinions; and whenas they themſelves, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about the rife of this diſeaſe, could not agree in this buſineſs, by much leſs ſhal we which are now removed above an age from that time, be able to reconcile them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhal only reckon up their opinions.

Though the greateſt part of mankind hath contracted this diſeaſe by contagion, it hath been obſerved, that a number of others infected by themſelves without any contagion, have ſuffred this diſeaſe. Beſides <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> thinks it impoſſible, that in ſo ſmal a time, contagion which of it ſelf is ſlow, nor is not eaſily received, could ſpread it ſelf over ſo many lands, being firſt brought by one fleet of the Spaniards, when it is plain that either at the ſame time, or very neere it was ſeen in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and almoſt al <hi>Scythia;</hi> which if it be ſo, there is no reaſon, why we ſhould not grant this diſeaſe to have been firſt of al epidemical: yet this makes me doubtful becauſe that no German Phyſitian, nor of the neighboring places, hath taken notice, that this diſeaſe was knowen in Germany about that time. In which it appeared in <hi>Italy,</hi> when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they have moſt diligently deſcribed, the Engliſh ſweating diſeaſe, the diſeaſe in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the like diſeaſes newly ſprung up.</p>
               <p>But what was the cauſe of that epidemious diſeaſe, if it were ſuch a one, thoſe Authers themſelves do differ in opinion; indeed they agree in this. That it had its original from the fault of the ayre, but whence the ayre contracted that fault, therein they differ. Some were of opinion, That this diſeaſe had its original, from the great inundation of <hi>Ether,</hi> and other Rivers, which hapned in the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixt, Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> for the Summer following they think by that corruption and filth left by the waters, the ayre was infected with putrefaction, and thence this diſeaſe did proceed. But truly this evil cannot be imputed to that inundation of waters, ſince that happned chiefly at <hi>Rome,</hi> but this diſeaſe firſt appeared at <hi>Naples:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, thoſe inundations of waters are wont rather to cauſe peſtilent diſeaſes, and there has often happned ſuch inundations before, yet ſuch a diſeaſe was never caul'd by them before. Others do more probably (if this diſeaſe were at firſt epidemious) refer the cauſe to the Stars. And <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> writes concerning this buſineſs, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de morb. contag. cap.</hi> 12. That it ought not to ſeem wonderful, that new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual diſeaſes do appeare at certain times, and he proves it by examples and hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of divers diſeaſes; and to paſs by others, in the memory of our Grandfather that malignant Feaver raged, which is commonly known by the name of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſweat, the like of which we have not read in any Hiſtory before, wherefore he thinks it is not ſtrange, if alſo the French diſeaſe not known before through many ages in our Orb, did now firſt of al break forth. And there wil come (ſaith he) other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37365:9"/>new and unuſual ſickneſſes, when time ſhal bring them; as there was the thing out amongſt the Ancients, which afterwards was ſeen no more. This ſame diſeaſe wil dye and be extinguiſht, and by and by again wil be renewed, and ſeen again by our Nephews, even as in former Ages, it is to be beleeved, it was ſeen by our Auce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſttors, for which there are no ſmal ſigns yet evident. A certain Barber a friend of mine, had a book of certain experiments, very ancient, amongſt which was written one amongſt the reſt, whoſe title was, For the thick ſcabb, which happens with the paines of the joints; he therefore when the diſeaſe was very freſh at firſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring this medicine, asked counſel of ſome Phyſitians; whether he might uſe that medicine in that new contagion, which he thought was ſignified by that thick ſcabb: but the Phyſitians viewing the medicine, ſharply forbad him, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of quickſilver and ſulphur. Happy man if he had not conſulted with thoſe phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, being like to be very rich with an incredible gaine; but he obeyed them, nor durſt not make tryal of his medicine, which at laſt he did try, and finding it to be excellent good, he was very ſorry, that he had uſed it too late, the profit being now carried away by others. Thus far <hi>Fracaſtorius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he refers the cauſe of this diſeaſe newly ſprung up, to the conjunction of <hi>Saturne, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which hapned at that time. Others hold that in the yeare, 1483. In the Ides of October at two of the clock after noon, That there was a conjunction made of <hi>Mars, Jupiter,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Lihra</hi> in the right houſe, which is the houſe of Sickneſs, and that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was burnt; and furthermore the ſame yeare on the Calends of November in the ſame houſe and ſigne, there was a conjunction made of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> alſo of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> Others as <hi>Nicolaus Maſſa de morb. Galic. cap.</hi> 6. refer that diſeaſe to the conjunction of <hi>Saturn Mars,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> which happened in <hi>Scorpio</hi> about the riſe of this diſeaſe. But as it is not impoſſible, for certain configurations of the Stars to induce certain diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo no man is able eaſily to render the ſpecifick cauſe of this diſeaſe, if it were epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demious. Truly al the effects of the Stars are good and benigne, and nothing evil in it ſelf doth proceed from them; yet by accident it may come to paſs, whiles they alter the ayre &amp; the bodies of men after this or that manner, that they may produce evil diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whenas in their way they are Authors of the generation and corruption of natural things, but that they could produce this diſeaſe in ſpecie, I think is not yet explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> had hopes indeed, that this diſeaſe was in its old age in his time, and that in a little while after it would ceaſe in the alleaged place; as alſo in his <hi>Syphilis,</hi> in theſe Verſes.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>For when the Fates ſhal pleaſe again, you'l ſee</l>

               </q>
               <p>But his hopes hath deceived him, whenas now it hath laſted above a hundred and forty yeares, and hath bated nothing of its cruelty, as moſt are of opinion.</p>
               <p>Others on the contrary think this diſeaſe was not epidemious, but ſporadical and contagious; and firſt of al this perſwades many, becauſe it hath laſted even unto theſe times, whenas epidemious diſeaſes, which have been raiſed by the influx of the Stars, have ceaſed a little while after. And therefore they do not think this difeaſe ought to be accounted for epidemical, whenas it hath already laſted above 140. years; unleſs perhaps this reaſon may be given for the continuance of this diſeaſe, becauſe the infection of this diſeaſe is not ſhunned, as that of the peſtilence. For if the Plague begin to ſpread any where, al people, as much as they are able, and 'tis poſſible for them, do fly from the converſation of the ſick, and reject al in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected houſehold ſtuff; nay in <hi>Italy,</hi> if the Plague begin to ſpread in <hi>Germany,</hi> or other neighbouring Countries, they ſtop up al publique waies, and deny al ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that are ſuſpected, any admittance into <hi>Italy;</hi> But many men knowingly and willingly have to do with ſuſpected Harlots, and publique Stews ful of infected whores are tolerated; therefore if the ſame diligence and cutioſity, which is uſed in ſome places in the time of the peſtilence to exclude the infected and ſuſpected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from the ſociety of others, were made uſe of to reſtrain that rambling whoring,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37365:10"/>perhaps this diſeaſe alſo though it be contagious, might be rooted out.</p>
               <p>Yet the ſame men who think this diſeaſe is not epidemous, but ſporadical, and contagious,
<note place="margin">How the Veneral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was brought into Europe.</note> are againe divided into divers opinions concerning its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: For ſome were of that opinion, that firſt of al it had its riſe at <hi>Valentia,</hi> in <hi>Hiſpania Tarraconenſi,</hi> where one ſick of an Elephantiaſis, bought a nights lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of a noble Whore for fifty peices of Gold, and infected her, and thence it came to paſs, that others who had to do with her were infected, and ſo in a ſhort time this evil was diſſemmated amongſt a many. But the Idea of an Elephantiaſis is one, and of the Veneral diſeaſe another, and therefore one ſick of an Elephantiaſis could not raiſe this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Others think this diſeaſe was firſt brought out of <hi>India</hi> by the Spaniards into the French Army at <hi>Naples,</hi> who maintame that this diſeaſe was epidemical in <hi>India,</hi> of which we ſpake before, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. But for what reaſon 'tis epidemious in ſome Countries in <hi>India,</hi> whether by the fault of the aire, or water, or proviſion, is not yet explained by Hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonbardus Fioravanti,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leonhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Fiora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanti his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Veneral diſeaſe.</note> a famous Empirick in his time in <hi>Italy,</hi> hath a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar opinion of the original of this diſeaſe, which I have met withal in no other writer. For he in his book written in the Italian Tongue, which is entituled, <hi>Capricci Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinali di M. Leonardo Fioravanti, Libritre,</hi> writes thus of the original of this diſeaſe, both amongſt the Indians, and in the French Army at <hi>Naples, lib.</hi> 1 <hi>Cap.</hi> 26. When ſaith he, there was War between the French and Spaniard at <hi>Naples,</hi> and there was great want of proviſion, eſpecially of fleſh, thoſe evil imployed merchants who brought victuals to the Camp, had privately prepared the Carkaſſes of dead ſouldiers into divers kinds of meates and diſhes, and ſold them every where about to the army, which fleſh, whanas they had eat of it a long time ignorantly, moſt of them were taken with this diſeaſe, and became ful of puſtles and paines, and many alſo had their hair fal off; and he writes, that he knowes the buſineſs was ſo, from one <hi>Paſchalis Gibilotius,</hi> a Neapolitan, an old man, of ninety eight yeares of age, who hath told him, that at that time when <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Renatus,</hi> Duke <hi>Ande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavenſis</hi> waged war againſt <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> about the yeare 1456. that he hath often heard from his father, who was ſuch a Merchant in the Army of King <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> that in want and ſcarcity of victuals the Souldiers on both ſides by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mans fleſh, which they fed on for a long time, contracted this diſeaſe, and the ſame <hi>Fioravanti,</hi> adds, that he might be the more certain of this buſineſs, he bred up a Sow in his houſe, and added to al her meat ſomewhat of hogs fleſh, and that within few dayes her briſtles and hairs fel off, and ſhe became ful of puſtles; then, that he fed a dog for two months only with dogs fleſh, which afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ful of pains and puſtles, and loſt his hair. From which experiments he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that every living creature if it be nouriſht with the fleſh of its own ſpecies wil be taken with this diſeaſe, which at this day is called the French: and he thinks this is the very cauſe, that this drſeaſe is epidemious in the <hi>Indies,</hi> becauſe there are thoſe man-eaters, which do feed on mans fleſh.</p>
               <p>But truly I do wonder that ſo many Italians and French, who have writ of this diſeaſe have made no mention of this cauſe, neither does the relation of that old <hi>Neapolitan</hi> ſeem to fit with the time. For that diſeaſe was not known in the year 1456. at which time <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Renatus, Duke Andegavenſis,</hi> waged War againſt <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> but in the War which <hi>Charles</hi> the eight King of <hi>France,</hi> waged with <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> about the yeare 1493 or 94. then grant it be, that if a creature nouriſht with the fleſh of thoſe of its own kind, be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with puſtles and pains, and ſuffer the falling off of the hair, yet the queſtion ſtil would be, whether that diſeaſe be the very Veneral diſeaſe, and ſuch as may be transfered by contagion to others, and eſpecially by Venery. For the eſſence of the veneral diſeaſe doth not conſiſt in puſtles, and the failling of the hair, but in an occult malignity, by which alſo its ulcers do differ from other ulcers. Yet it is eaſy for any one to make tryal, of that which <hi>Fioravanti</hi> experienced. And if the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37365:10"/>buſineſs ſhould be confirmed by experience, that if an animal nouriſht with the fleſh of its kind, do contract this diſeaſe, thence a reaſon may be rendered, why this diſeaſe is endemious to the people of <hi>India,</hi> to wit, becauſe its inhabitants do feed on mens fleſh: although here we meet with a doubt, for al the people of <hi>India</hi> are not men-eaters, and therefore we muſt enquire out of the Hiſtories of the <hi>Indies,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this diſeaſe be endemious amongſt the men-eaters only, or amongſt the other people of the <hi>Indies</hi> alſo.</p>

<note place="margin">Andreas Caeſalpinus.</note> writes that he hath another Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the original of this diſeaſe, delivered by them who were preſent, to wit, from an Atetine ſoldier, who ſerved in that war; he related that there is a town in the <hi>Veſuvian</hi> Mount which is called <hi>Suma,</hi> where there is plenty of generous wine which is called Caudy wine, which was privately left by the Spaniards in the night, when the French had beſieged it, but they infected their wine by the mixture of blood which they drew from them which were ſick in the hoſpital of St. <hi>Lazarus;</hi> and the French men entering in, when they had filled themſelves with that wine, began to be ſick of diſeaſes and ſymptomes, like unto the Elephantiaſis. But if this were true, rather the Elephantiaſis than the veneral diſeaſe had been thus raiſed.
<note place="margin">Aurelius Minadous.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurelius Minadous de Virul. Vener. Cap.</hi> 30. propounds a peculiar opinion, &amp; holds that this virulency did firſt break forth from the moſt filthy wombs, of moſt impure Harlots, and for this cauſe, becauſe no body that hath lived cleanly, or that hath converſed with a cleane woman, is taken with this evil: but he thinks this evil proceeded firſt, when women were made very unclean, when they had received a various mixture of ſeeds. For as ſaith he one ſort of meat, is the cauſe of health in a good ſtomach, but variety of meats doth oppreſs the ſtomach, and breeds an acid and nidorous crudity, and every where heaps up excrements; ſo one ſeed only is familier and wholſome for one womb, and cauſeth fruitfulneſs, on the contrary the multitude and variety of ſeeds, doth ſo affect the womb, that by its corruption it produceth bad, nay the worſt of excrements, and from that ſordid ſubſtance there is a corruprion hard to be explained, or putrefaction which doth generate ſuch vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate excrements. But when as he might eaſily underſtand, that thoſe rambling luſts were in uſe not only in the war at <hi>Naples,</hi> but long before when there was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Brothel Houſes at <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet there was no ſuch diſeaſe raiſed; he would have his opinion to be underſtood not of any women, but only of the <hi>Indian.</hi> For they by the mediation of the Heaven, Air, Waters, and thoſe places, by their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar form of feeding did contract this poyſon, which afterwards by <hi>Columbus,</hi> and the Spaniſh Army was diſſeminated in <hi>France,</hi> and hence through the whole world. But though it muſt not be denied, that the conſtitution of bodies is divers in divers Countries, and I remember that I have read in the Hiſtories of Navigation, That when certain people of <hi>Europe,</hi> had found certain Ethiopian laſſes playing on the ſea ſhore, and had layn with them, preſantly ſome of them died; yet how the buſineſs is in <hi>America,</hi> is worthy of further inquiſition: and if there be any ſuch fault in thoſe women, 'tis probable that comes to paſs, not ſo much from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtion of divers ſeeds, but rather as many Authors report, from this, That if any one have to do with a woman in <hi>India</hi> whiles ſhe hath her courſes, he his taken with that diſeaſe; for that whenas 'tis every where un wholſome, and therefore alſo was peculiarly and ſeverely forbidden the Jewes by God in holy Writ, may in a ſpecial manner be hurtful in the Indies.</p>
               <p>Therefore lecting theſe paſs, let us hold faſt this, which is granted by al,
<note place="margin">The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſe is contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only by Contagion.</note> that this diſeaſe at this day is no otherwiſe contracted, but by contagion, and chiefly by lying with thoſe that are infected, whence deſervedly doth <hi>Gabriel Fallopius de morb. Gallic. Cap.</hi> 13. Wittily deride thoſe women, who when they were ſick of the Veneral diſeaſe, nevertheleſs did boſt themſelves to be chaſt, and ſaid they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted this diſeaſe by ſprinkling themſelves with the holy water which was infected.</p>
               <p>But this contagion, by which only now adayes,
<note place="margin">How many waies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion may be contracted.</note> we ſay this diſeaſe is diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is received divers waies. For ſometimes 'tis transferred with the ſeed and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37365:11"/>blood from the Parents to the Child,
<note place="margin">Somtimes 'tis Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.</note> and the Diſeaſe become Haereditary; for when the blood, out of which the Seed is generated, is infected and vitious, the like Diſeaſed ſeed is generated, alſo the Mothers blood being impure, with which the Child is nouriſht, it Pollutes that, which pollution afterwards in thoſe brought into the World doth ſooner or later ſhew it ſelf, according to the greater or leſſer ſtrength of that virulency: which manner of original of this Diſeaſe, if any one wil deny to be properly by contagion, becauſe it is not by the contract of two bodies, viz. a ſound and a ſick, he may for al me; yet let him know this, that then that malignity in the body of the infant is not generated, but from the infected parents by the ſeed, or the Mothers blood is communicated to the off-ſpring.</p>
               <p>But by thoſe that are born into the world, the ſame evil may be contracted two waies: the firſt is, when with the nouriſhment and milk, the evil is communicated to infants by imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ute Nurſes; which way indeed is the powerfulleſt of al: for whenas the milk they ſuck is changed into blood, and that is the nouriſhment of the whol body, the poyſon this way is diſperſed into the whol body, and inſinuates it ſelf moſt intimately with it, and therefore thoſe that are this way infected, are ſeldome cured, and not without a great deal of Difficulty.</p>
               <p>The other way is by contagion ſo called properly, and in ſpecy; where firſt of al 'tis enquired, whether there be any contagion in the Veneral Diſeaſe at a diſtance, ſo that if one do neither touch with his body one infected, nor the fuel which conteins in it the contagion, yet nevertheleſs may be infected with the Veneral Diſeaſe; truly there is no example given of this cauſe, but what <hi>Manardus</hi> teacheth, Lib. 7. Epiſ. 3. and alſo ſome others affirme that there is a French Ophthalmy: but when as this Diſeaſe of the Eyes in other caſes is oftentimes contagiout, it is no wonder, if one converſing with a ſick man that is troubled with a French Ophthalmy, and earneſtly look upon his Eyes,
<note place="margin">Whether it can infect at a diſtance.</note> that he alſo may contract luch an Ophthalmy. Yet this cannot be granted, that as the Plague may be transferred by the Air to others in diſtant places, ſo alſo the Veneral Diſeaſe may be communicated; for dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth Teſteſie, that Phyſitians and many others, do familiarly converſe with thoſe infected with this evil, yet are not infected by them.</p>
               <p>Therefore this evil is chiefly contracted by contact, and truely moſt frequently by whoriſh Copulation, when that virulence is communicated to the naked genital parts being ſoft, and porous, from the genitals of the other infected perſon; after which manner this Diſeaſe was firſt brought out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> by the Spaniſh Souldiers infected by the <hi>Indian</hi> Women which were ſick of this Diſeaſe, into <hi>Italy,</hi> and diſſeminated through the French Camp, and hence ſpred throughout all Europe, as we ſaid before according to the opinion of many Phyſitians. And though ſome as we ſaid even now, who have been infected with this Diſeaſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to renounce the Cauſe of it;
<note place="margin">How the Veneral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe may be contracted.</note> yet many if they live not chaſtly, yet they live cloſely, and <hi>Gabriel Fallopius,</hi> not without a Cauſe de <hi>Morb. Gall. cap.</hi> 10. ſcoffs at certain chaſt Matrons, as they boaſted themſelves to be, who ſaid they contracted this Diſeaſe by ſprinkling them with holy water which was polluted; he that beleeves this, let him beleeve that too, which <hi>Averroes</hi> writes, 2. <hi>collect. cap.</hi> 10 that a woman was got with Child in a bath, from ſome ſeed which wicked men had ſpent there: or with <hi>Valleſius</hi> let him cotrect the Aphoriſme, 36. Sect. 6. becauſe many Monks have been ſick of the Gout before the uſe of Venery.</p>
               <p>And truly men contract this evil from Women that are infected,
<note place="margin">How men are infected by women in Copulation.</note> becauſe in the act by reaſon of the concourſe of ſpirits, and the motion, the Womb being heated, Vapors are raiſed from the Malignant Humors in the womb, which are ſuckt in by the mans yard being of a porous conſtitution, and are received into the veins. But the man being infected, may infect a ſound woman, either by his yard, if that be infected and exulcerated,
<note place="margin">How Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by men.</note> or by his ſeed, although his yard be not ulcerated, or both waies: for though the ſeed in men is not always wholly corrupt, whenas we ſee many men infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this diſeaſe do get children; yet it is altered &amp; infected, from whence not only
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37365:11"/>the Iſſue contracts this evil, but alſo a Woman may be infected by it.</p>
               <p>But though this evil be moſt frequently contracted by whoriſh Copulation,
<note place="margin">Other waies of contagion</note> yet by contagion it may be derived to others, other manner of waies, viz. by ſweat, if any one ſleep in the ſame bed with one infected with the Veneral Diſeaſe, and be wet with his ſweat; then by the filth and Excrements, or that flowing from Ulcers, and ſticking on the Linnen, bed, or ſhirt, and garments, if any one he in them, or put them on. The ſame Diſeaſe alſo may be communicated by ſlaver or ſpittle, ſo lovers are infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Kiſſes of Whores ſick of this Diſeaſe, and infants by their Nurſes, or if any one drink out of a Cup, or ſup out of the ſpoon, which one ſick of this Diſeaſe did uſe a little before; beſides, infants may be infected another way, to wit if, they touch the breſts of an impure Nurſe with their mouth, and that for a double reaſon, either becauſe they ſuck the infected and corrupted milk, of which I ſpeake before; or becauſe the breaſts and nibbles of the Nurſe are exulcerated: on the contrary, Nurſes may be infected from infected infants, eſpecially if they be troubled with Malignant puſtles, or ſome Ulcer in the mouth; for the Nepples of their breaſts whiles they are ſuckt by the Infant, grow hot, and their pores are more opened, whereupon they eaſier receive in that virulence.</p>
               <p>But no body is eaſily infected by the breath, as was ſaid before, and without danger we may be converſant in the ſame chamber with thoſe that are infected; neither are thoſe Chyrurgions and Phyſitians which cure the veneral Diſeaſe, and dayly converſe with the ſick, any way infected; and if this Diſeaſe were contagious by breathing and at a diſtance, the whol world would ere now have been French, and the Diſeaſe would be more than Epidemious, as one writes; yet if any one ſleep in bed with one infected, that he do receive his breath very neer, I wil not promiſe him free from this evil; whenas I know, Wives that have been infected by their Husbands ſick of the Phthiſick, and afterwards died of it.</p>
               <p>This contagion after 'tis received into the body,
<note place="margin">How the Veneral vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulency doth penetrate into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> ſtaies not in thoſe parts in which it was firſt received, but after the manner of other poyſons, penetrates into the innermoſt parts of the body: and truely oftentimes diſcovers it ſelf preſently, within a few daies, ſomtimes lies hid a long while. And <hi>Fernelius</hi> writes, <hi>de abdit. rer. Cauſ. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 14. That it doth ſomtimes returne and revive after thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years paſt, and for ſo long ſpace the fewel of the diſeaſe does lie hid as dormant, and nevertheleſs they who think themſelves free from al hurt, and that they are perfectly ſound, do corrupt thoſe with whom they lie, and beget an Iſſue poſſeſt with that Diſeaſe. The ſame is witneſſed by <hi>John Philippus Ingraſſias.</hi> And <hi>Hercules Saxonia de lue Vener. cap.</hi> 11. relates that he cured an Illuſtriſſimo, who had knobs of the French Diſeaſe came out upon him, five and twenty years after he had taken the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>But what parts this virulency doth principally aſſault, we ſaid formerly Authors did diſagree, where we treated of its ſubject; many indeed do hold,
<note place="margin">What parts are chiefly affected.</note> that this virulency is chiefly an adverſary to the Membranes, becauſe the pains do moſt of al ariſe about the Perioſtia, and external parts, where are many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, in the head, Legs, Arms, breaſt-bone, and in them the perioſtium being eaten off, are raiſed knobs. But not only the Membranous parts are affected, but others alſo, as the Buboes, Tumors, Uleers in divers parts, rottenneſs of the bones, falling of the hair, running of the Reins do teſtefie. And therefore we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for a more common ſubject, which we ſaid above was the Liver, and the ſimilar parts dedicated to nutrition, and that have conſent with the liver; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the contagion hath pierced as far as the Liver (though in the interim it may cortupt the parts neer unto that, by which the Contagion was received) and hath imprinted a Malignant diſpoſition on that, Sanguification is hurt, and a Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant quality is imprinted on that blood, which is generated in the Liver, and ſo with the blood are generated Malignant Humors, which whenas they are trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to Nature, they are thruſt forth to the Circumference of the body, and ſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37365:12"/>not only pains are raiſed in the Membranes, but divers Diſeaſes and Symptomes alſo in other parts; and whereas the bones are not free, but they are oftentimes affected with rottenneſs, it is no wonder that the neighbouring perioſtia are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and moſt cruel pains raiſed.</p>
               <p>From al which it doth eaſily appear,
<note place="margin">The manner of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the veneral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> what is the manner of the generation of this Diſeaſe, to wit, When the contagion of this Diſeaſe is communicated from one ſick of the Veneral Diſeaſe, either by the ſeed and blood of the parents, or by the ſucking of infected milk, or by Copulation, or by ſpittle, or by meat and drink, or by garments and Linnen, to any part of a ſound body, firſt of al the part which receives the contagion is affected and hurt, hence through that, the evil creeps into the Veins, and by them penetrates to the Liver, which when it hath put on an evil diſpoſition, and contracted a Malignant Diſeaſe, it generates viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood, containing in it the Seeds of the veneral Diſeaſe, which whenas it is an enemy to the body, by the expulſive faculty 'tis driven from the more noble parts to the Circumference of the body. And from thence the nouriſhment in the whol body is hurt, from whence are raiſed ſpots, Tumors, and divers bunchings out, Ulcers, falling of the hair, pains, and other evils.</p>
               <p>At length out of al thoſe things which have been ſaid hitherto of the Nature and cauſes of the veneral diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the veneral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> we make this definition of this Diſeaſe.

               </head>
               <p>BY ſome indeed there are reckoned up very many Differences of this Diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">The Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note> and by <hi>Braſſavola,</hi> 234. but many of them unprofitable; the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and profitable are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt of al, as concerning the very eſſence of the Diſeaſe whenas that is unknown, from that of it ſelf, we can raiſe no difference: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its activity depends on that eſſence and occult quality, theſe differences are fetcht from thence, becauſe the activity of this diſeaſe is ſomtimes greater, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs. And Phyſitians have obſerved, that ſomtimes after unwholſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, the French Symptoms have preſently come upon men, but ſomewhat gentle, and a little while after have ceaſed again, without the adminiſtration of any remedy; but ſomtimes moſt grievous Symptoms have preſenly come on them, and the evil hath been rebellious, and could by no means or very difficultly be cured.
<note place="margin">At its firſt riſe this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</note> And the writers of this diſeaſe report, That this Diſeaſe when it firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, had far more grievous Symptomes, than now it hath: but what was the Cauſe of this buſineſs, is not ſo clear. That might happen firſt of al, from the diſpoſition of the bodies that were infected. For whenas it appeared firſt in the Camps at Naples, and there was a great ſcarcity of proviſion, and a famine, doubtleſs in thoſe bodies alſo, there was proviſion of evil Humors for Diſeaſes, on which when this contagion fel, there it took ſtrength and increaſed: beſides this might make ſomwhat to that buſineſs, that in the beginning, the cure of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was not ſufficiently known, whence it came to paſs, that this malignity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies grew worſe. This happens alſo in the Plague, of which the more there die, the poyſon alwaies grows the more vehement. For the malignity is fermented as it were, and exalted in the bodies of the ſick, unleſs it be oppoſed and overcome by Alexipharmacal means.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:37365:12"/>
               <p>Secondly, its Differences are taken from the cauſes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of contagion while ſomtimes the Veneral Diſeaſe is haereditary, and is derived with the ſeed and blood from the parents to the Iſſue: but ſomtimes after the birth, is communicated by Copulation, Kiſſing, Milk, Garments, and the like.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the third Difference is taken from the Diſeaſes and Symptoms ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that this Diſeaſe is ſomtimes with Buboes, ſomtimes with running of the Reins, ſomtimes with falling of the hair, ſomtimes with pains of the joynts, ſomtimes wich other Symptomes; neither do the Symptomes which follow it, and ſhal afterwards be reckoned up amongſt the ſigns, alwaies appear the ſame in al people: and <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi> writes, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Morb. occult. Cap.</hi> 9. That he hath obſerved a thouſand times, that many young men have on the ſame day co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated with one and the ſame whore, and yet notwithſtanding one hath been taken with the running of the Reins, another with a Bubo another with rottenneſs, another with pain in the Head, another with falling of the hair, and another with another different preternatural affect; which doubtleſs happens, by reaſon of the various indiſpoſition of bodies, and weakneſs of parts, and variety of Humors. For weak parts do more eaſily receive vitious Humors, than the ſtrong. And one body is more clean, another more foul, and abounds with theſe, or thoſe Humors, which when they are cotrupted by the venenate Humor, do cauſe theſe or thoſe Diſeaſes and Symptomes: therefore if we ſhould number up the Differences according to the variety of Diſeaſes, and Symptomes, which are ſomtimes joyned together and complicated, ſomtimes Fewer, ſomtimes more, we might make very many indeed, of which as was ſaid even now, <hi>Braſſavola</hi> reckons up 234. more Nicely than profitably.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the fourth Difference is from the time, that the Diſeaſe is ſomtimes new, ſomtimes inveterate, one in the beginning, another in the augment, another in the ſtate and another in the declination.</p>
               <p>Out of which, and eſpecially from the Difference of time, and the variety of Diſeaſes, and Symptomes that accompany this Diſeaſe, <hi>Julianus Palmarius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Degrees of the veneral diſeaſe.</note> doth commodiouſly conſtitute four dergees of this Diſeaſe, <hi>de lue Vener. Lab</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. The Firſt and lighteſt degree is, when only the hairs of the Head and beard do by little and little fal off, without any other hurt of the body. The Second degree is worſe, when the whol Skin is ſpread over with many ſpots not bunching out, and thoſe ſomtimes ſmal, like to a lentil ſpeck; ſomtimes much broader, and both, ſomtimes red, ſomtimes yellow. The Third degree is yet more grievous, when not only ſpots but true puſtles and bunches break forth, firſt of al indeed about the forehead, and Temples, and behind the Ears, then every where in the Head, and at length in the reſt of the body. The Fourth degree is, when now the Diſeaſe being inveterate, it aſſaults and corrupts the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid parts, the bones, Ligaments, Membranes, and Nerves. In which there are collected many thick, glutinous, and maligne Excrements, which when they reſt about the tendons, or the Perioſtia, and prick and pul the Membranes from the bones, there are wont to be cauſed implacable pains, growing worſe towards the night, from which Excrements alſo by degrees do grow hard knobs, with far greater torment which are equally hard as the bones. Which if they be fixt in the bones, they do ſo enlarge and diſtend them, that the bones oftentimes become of a monſtrous bulk and figure: moreover that malignity and Acrimony doth by degrees eat away, and with rottenneſs conſume the bones, and for the moſt part not hurting the Skin that lies over them: and <hi>Palmarius</hi> writes there, that he hath ſeen many in whom the Pericranium, and the Skul under it, hath been found wholly eaten away with putrefaction, and conſumed with rottenneſs as far as the dura mater, the Skin of the Head not being hurt at al, without any Feaver, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37365:13"/>without vomiting, of which one or two have been ſeen living without a Skul. Of which by and by ſhal be ſaid more in the Diagnoſtick and Prognoſtick ſigns.</p>

               <p>BUt though out of thoſe things which have been ſpoken before of the Hiſtory of this Diſeaſe, the Diagnoſtick ſigns of this Diſeaſe might eaſily be fetcht, yet in this place the ſame are to be propounded in ſpecy. But firſt of al, we muſt remember this, thoſe ſigne as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, 1. Aphor. 17. and elſe where, which ought certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to denote a Diſeaſe, which are commonly called Pathognomonical, ought to be not only proper but inſeparable, ſo that where they are, there is the Diſeaſe, and they being taken away the Diſeaſe is removed. But though as in many other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
<note place="margin">The diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick ſigns of the cauſe.</note> ſo in the Veneral, there is not one ſign, by which the Diſeaſe may be known, yet a concourſe of ſigns, may do the ſame. Yet what that concourſe is in the Veneral Diſeaſe, is not eaſie to define: whenas in this Diſeaſe there is a great Accumulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Symptoms and Diſeaſes, and therefore this Diſeaſe hath affinity with other Diſeaſes. Which thing doth cauſe, as was ſaid before, that many when they ſaw almoſt the ſame concourſe of ſigns, in that Epidemious diſeaſe, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> propounds, the 3. <hi>Epid.</hi> they thought the Veneral Diſeaſe was deſcribed there, and others referred it to the Elephantiaſis, but the reaſon why it is hard to define the concourſe of ſigns in this Diſeaſe, is this, becauſe the Liver and nutritive faculty of the whol body is chiefly hurt. For when the heart or brain is hurt, their hurt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do eaſily appear, being ſuch as are ſimple, and reſtrained to few parts. But when as the Lives affords nouriſhment for the whol body, from thence if nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>vers Diſeaſes and Symptomes; for though the nutriment of the whol body be one, that is blood, yet almoſt an innumerable variety preſents it ſelf in every part, according to the variety of the parts which are nouriſht, whenas 'tis neceſſary that every part do peculiarly aſſimilate its nouriſhment; yet if we conſider the precedent cauſes, thoſe things which are preſent, and what things are helpful, what hurtful, or the Remedies, neither can this Diſeaſe he undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>As concerning the cauſes, firſt of al if the parents be, or have been ſick of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and ſome ſigns in the infant preſent themſelves, which argue the Veneral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, there is ſcarce any reaſon to doubt of the Diſeaſe. In like manner 'tis, if an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanchave ſucked a nurſe ſick of this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>But if any one born of ſound Patents, and nouriſht by the milk of a ſound Nurſe, yet have diſeaſes and ſome Symptoms, which give ſuſpition of this Diſeaſe, we muſt diligently enquire, whether he hath had to do with infected perſons; which if he confeſs, the caſe is plain, and there need no further doubt of the ſpecies of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; but if, as it often fals out, one to preſerve his Honor and reputation, deny that he hath acted any ſuch thing, then we muſt enquire into the condition and courſe of the life paſt, of the husband or wife, if the party be married. For from theſe things ſomtimes we have no ſlight conjectures of the infection. But if there be no ground for ſuch a conjecture, we muſt further enquire, whether he hath ſlept in the ſame bed with one infected with that Diſeaſe, or hath uſed his garments. But if out of al theſe there can be had no firme conjecture of this Diſeaſe, the preſent ſtate of the patient is diligently to be conſidered, which indeed is one in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, another in the increaſe, and another when 'tis inveterate; whence alſo the ſigns of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, beginning, encreaſing, inveterate, are wont commonly to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And truely to know this Diſeaſe when 'tis Inveterate, is not very difficult, as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37365:13"/>ſhal be ſaid by and by: but whiles it yet lies, and is in the firſt blade, then to know it, is not ſo eaſie. For as plants and trees when they are at ful growth, are known by the vulgar, but to know them at their firſt appearance, is the part only of an artiſt and good herbariſt. So alſo this Diſeaſe, when it diſcovers it ſelf by diverſe Diſeaſes, and Symptomes, 'tis known even by the vulgar, but when it lirks in obſcurity, 'tis not diſcovered but by experienced Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>Yet there are ſome ſigns, which may diſcover this Diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">The ſigns of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſe in its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> even at the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; the firſt is, that they who are taken with this Diſeaſe do preſently (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the appearance of any ſigns of a Feaver imminent) perceive a kind of weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and heavineſs in their whol body, and ſomtimes a drowſineſs after ſleep. There is a vehement and wandering pain, which is felt ſomtimes in the Head, ſomtimes in the Muſcles, ſomtimes about the joynts, and this pain is more troubleſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night than at other times of the day. The freſh color of the Face is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſtrangely, and ſome write, that there is a Livid circle appears under their Eyes, ſuch as we uſually ſee in Women that have their Courſes: there is added to theſe a ſadneſs, fear, and thoſe that before were merry and jeſting, become ſad and penſive without any cauſe. All which ſigns are of greater force if the ſigns of the Veneral Diſeaſe did go before, and vaniſh without any convenient, and ſufficient means. And truely if this evil be contracted by Copulation, and hath not yet plainly poſſeſt the Liver, but ſticks yet in the Privities, then chiefly this Veneral Diſeaſe at its beginning, diſcovers it ſelf by the running of the Reins, Ulcers in the Privities, and buboes, for when that Malignant vapor, is firſt of al communicated to the Teſticles and genital veſſels, the ſeed is corrupted, and the generation of ſeed is depraved in the genital veſſels: whence inſtead of good ſeed there is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated a ſtinking and corrupt Humor, which doth irritate Nature to expulſion. From whence alſo the Gonorrhaea, although improperly ſo called, is eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from that running of the Reins which is not French, becauſe this galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal is joyned with a great heat, and pain, ſomtimes alſo with an Inflamation of the Teſticles, and Veſſels reſembling a varix; the matter which is caſt forth is far different from ſeed, viz. yellow, green, Acrid, corroding the glans; neither doth it yeild to thoſe Remedies, with which a true Gonorrhaea is cured. Next of all there appeare puſtles in the Privities about the bigneſs of a grain of Millet, and ſomtimes they compaſs the whol Ring, which when they are broken, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main white Ulcers which in proceſs of the Diſeaſe grow deep and callous, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colors, and with pain joyned with them. Thirdly, alſo Buboes ſhow forth themſelves in this Diſeaſe; for though ſomtimes the Buboes do precede an Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas or a Roſe, yet then there went before thoſe cauſes which do effect a Roſe, as fear, frights, anger, and the bubo is extended towards the Thighs, as it were by a red line, and a little after the Eryſipelas breaking forth, it vaniſheth; but if the Bubo be Veneral, 'tis not extended according to the longitude of the Thigh, but rather obliquely, and imitates the ſituation of the ſpermatick Veſſels. For in unwholſome Copulation the ſeminal veſſels are eaſily firſt of al infected, which whenas they have their Original from the Vena Cava not far from the Liver it ſelf, that virulency is eaſily communicated to the Liver, which being affected drives it back again by the ſame waies from it ſelf, from whence are cauſed both the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes, and the running of the Reins. And thus theſe two Diſeaſes are for the moſt part complicated, and being Joyned are a ſure ſign of the veneral Diſeaſe, and one failing, the other is of force; but if this evil be contracted without whoriſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, and if by kiſſing, there are Ulcers raiſed about the mouth, if by giving ſuck to an infected infant, there are inflamations about the breaſts, puſtles, and clefts; if from Garments and common lying together, there are puſtles every where raiſed in the Skin.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:37365:14"/>
               <p>But if the evil do now increaſe,
<note place="margin">The ſigns of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> and grow more grievous, and the virulency it ſelf be already communicated to the Liver, and thence the nutrition in the whol body be depraved, diſeaſes and ſymptomes of al kinds, ſuch as were reckoned up before, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. in the hiſtory of this diſeaſe, do ariſe, which indeed though ſingly by themſelves they afford not a proper and inſeparable ſigne of this diſeaſe, yet if they be taken together, and their peculiar condition be diligently conſidered, they may clearly enough detect this evil. For there is ſcarce another diſeaſe, in which there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of al theſe, nay there are many of them ſo proper to the Veneral diſeaſe, that they are found in no other diſeaſe after that manner. How the buboes which are ſeen in the beginning, and ſometimes in the increaſe of this diſeaſe, may be diſtinguiſht from other buboes, was ſaid even now; theveneral puſtles are ſome of them cruſty, others without a cruſt, the cruſty are chiefly the ſigns of this diſeaſe, and ſometimes they are eminent, that in the head and forehead they reſemble the horns of a Ram, under which ſomtimes is contained matter. Somtimes none, and they appeare in the face, head, beard, whol body, but eſpecially about the privities and hips, And <hi>Fallopius</hi> writes that theſe kinds of Veneral tumors, may be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe which are not Veneral after this manner; That the Veneral if they be rubbed and the skin taken off, three daies after they appear unchanged, but benign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles if they be rubbed, are increaſed by the attraction of blood, and that good, and alimentary. So the the tumors which are commonly called Gummeſities, it they be joined with a ſwelling, or do firmly adhere to the parts void of fleſh, and the bones, eſpecially if they be in the head, forehead, in the fore part of the Leggs, area moſt certain ſigne of the Veneral diſeaſe: for the Veneral matter hath an eating vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulency even in a cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>BUt that we may know, what hopes there is concerning the event of this diſeaſe, we muſt enquire whether the diſeaſe is like to be ſhort, or long, whether eaſy or hard to be cured, and at laſt what end it ſhal have.</p>
               <p>But firſt of al concerning this diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">Whether this diſeaſe ſhal ceaſe.</note> 'tis wont to be queſtioned amongſt ſome Phyſitians in general, whether it ſhal once have an end? <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> indeed did hope for it, as was ſaid before, and thought, that even in his time this diſeaſe grew aged and that a little while after it would wholly die, chiefly for this reaſon, becauſe he thought it was epidemious, and took its original from the Starrs, which impreſſions of heaven do not laſt alwaies, but in proceſs of time are changed, and becauſe he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37365:15"/>ſaw this diſeaſe did grow more mild. For as <hi>Jul. Palmarius</hi> writes of this ſubject <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de lue Vener. Cap.</hi> 5. it was reported, that this diſeaſe at its firſt riſe was ſo filthy, that that which reigns now is ſcarce thought to be of the ſame kind; for there were innumerable ulcers, rough and ſtanding out, in the figure and bulk of an acorn, a filthy humor flowing from them, and ſuch a ſtink exhaling that his noſe that it reached, was beleeved preſently to be infected. The colour of the puſtles was between black and green, as much tormenting the ſick with the ſight of them, as with their pain. Therefore al people did ſhun the ſight of them, and ſo abſtain from touching them, as in no diſeaſe beſides. But <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> his hopes deceived him, for as yet we do not ſee this diſeaſe grow old, much leſs ceaſe, and though the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ulcers and puſtles be more tolerable, yet in pains and torments it is grown more cruel, as the ſame <hi>Palmarius</hi> writes. It is more likely, that as long as thoſe copulations and converſings wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h infected people, and wandering luſts ſhal indure, ſo long alſo this diſeaſe wil laſt, and be propagated by contagion. For ſuch is the nature of this poyſon that it doth not ſuddenly kil a man, in the interim thoſe who are ſick of that diſeaſe, are infect ous thoſe waies, of which we ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Whenas therefore there are every where many, who are poluted with that diſeaſe, and others converſe with them, there is yet no hopes that this diſeaſe ſhould ceaſe are long, whenas the effect doth not ceaſe, unleſs the cauſe be taken away. Neither is that reaſon firm enough, which ſome who are of a contrary opinion do alledg; for they ſay whenas this diſeaſe is a contagion preternatural and violent, it muſt neceſſarily have an end, whenas thoſe things which are preternatural and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent have not perpetual cauſes, and therefore muſt needs ceaſe to be; but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is eaſie; nothing indeed that is preternatural and violent, is of it ſelf perpetual, yet if the cauſe be perpetual, that alſo may be perpetual. Therefore though as the plague is ſometimes extinguiſhed, ſo this diſeaſe alſo might be, if the ſame diligence were uſed, which is in preventing and curing the plague, as was ſaid before: yet becauſe there are alwaies men, who are ſick of this diſeaſe, and can infect others, and others do not abſtain from their ſociety, even this diſeaſe ſhal continue ſo long, as that contagion ſhal laſt. And therefore <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi> rightly of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Morb. occult. Cap.</hi> 11. writes, if there were one prince of the whol world, or one conſpiracy of many of them againſt this diſeaſe, by the help of phyſitians this diſeaſe might be wholly rooted out; viz. if they who are ſick of this diſeaſe, were al committed to phyſitians to be cured, in the interim were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ſociety of other men, and the ſame were done with the infected with this diſeaſe, as is wont to be with thoſe infected with the plague or leproſie, there were hopes this diſeaſe might be extirpated; &amp; for this cauſe too, becauſe the Veneral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is not contagious at a diſtance as the plague is, but for the moſt part is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by copulation, ſomtimes by kiſſing and garments. But here is no diligence uſed, and as the ſame <hi>Rudius</hi> ſaith, Theeves, robbers, and murderers, and other wicked perſons are ſharply puniſhed, but publique whores ful of this diſeaſe, and who daily deſtroy more than a thouſand men, &amp; polute whol Families and Cities, are cheriſht, ſmoothed up with ſlateries, and kept gallantly. But leaving theſe, let us ſee what may be foretold of every particular diſeaſed patient.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> The Veneral diſeaſe for the moſt part of it ſelf, is a diſeaſe of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for this reaſon, Becauſe the liver principally, and the nutritive faculty is infected in it. But <hi>Galen</hi> teaches rightly, 5. <hi>de lo. affect. Cap.</hi> 2. That of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the heart al people die moſt ſpeedily, of affects of the brain more ſlowly, but the life is longer protracted when the natural actions are hurt; and though the veneral diſeaſe be alſo malignant, and is not undeſervedly reckoned amongſt poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in its kind, yet its power in acting is fat ſlower, than that of other poyſons: yet the vehemency or weakneſs of this poyſon in this or that body, and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the body, may make ſomewhat to the length or ſhortneſs of this diſeaſe; for if the poyſon be more vehement, the diſeaſe is the more dangerous, as ſhal be ſaid by and by: if alſo the body before did abound with vitious humors, the evil is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37365:15"/>increaſed, and made longer: and indeed ſometimes the ſtubbornneſs of this diſeaſe is ſuch, that though it ſeem ſometimes to be wholly extinct, yet it hath been obſerved that it hath ſometimes grown freſh againe after many, nay, thirty years, as was ſaid before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But whether this diſeaſe wil be hard or eaſie to cure in any patient, muſt be judged from the greatneſs of the diſeaſe, and ſtrength of the patient, as in other diſeaſes. Firſt of al, as concerning the nature of the diſeaſe it ſelf, though this diſeaſe be far more gentle, than other venenate diſeaſes, yet becauſe it is not of the number of them which depend on manifeſt diſtempers, but malignant and contagious, it may infect al the humors in the whole body, nay it may pollute al the Similar parts, and hence it is hard to be cured.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet this diſeaſe when 'tis new is eaſier to cure, than when 'tis inveterate; for in that new malignant quality, it only affects thoſe parts, by which 'tis propagated and for the moſt part the privities, but in the inveterate diſeaſe, that very malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant quality is imprinted alſo on the liver, and from the liver again is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the blood, and by the blood to al ſimilar parts; for it is falſe, as appeares out of thoſe things which have been formerly ſaid of the nature of this diſeaſe, that the liver here is hurt in ſanguification, by no diſeaſe, but only by reaſon of an evil object, which mixt with the blood and other humors, does pollute them, deprave and make them vitious, and convert them into its own nature: indeed 'tis not to be denied, that vitious humors alſo do corrupt the good, in the interim from good chyle alſo in a liver evil diſpoſed is generated bad blood, which appears even from this, that through every part the nutrition a little while after is infected through the whol body, which could not be, unleſs the liver were hurt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Epiph. Ferdinandus</hi> writes, Hiſt. 17. That he hath learned by experience, and that other phyſitians have obſerved the ſame, that thoſe who being once cured are again infected with this diſeaſe, are either never, or with a great deal of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty recovered.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Although the nature of this virulency doth not conſiſt in any manifeſt diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yet if it light on a body hot and dry, and eſpecially endewed with a hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of the liver, 'tis more difficultly cured. For whenas pock-wood, Sarſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla, and the like, are hot and dry, that hot and dry diſtemper is increaſed, and ſo, though this very diſeaſe be not increaſed, yet another damage is brought upon the body, and whenas thoſe proper medicines cannot ſafely be adminiſtred, unleſs the body before were very wel purged, by theſe means 'tis heated and dryed the more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For the ſame cauſe, a hot and dry ſeaſon of the yeare, as that of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is, is not ſo fit for the cure of this diſeaſe, whenas the ſtrength is then Exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If alſo the ſtrength be ſeeble, that it cannot undergoe thoſe ſtrong medicines which are neceſſary, or if the ſick, out of cuſtom or peeviſhneſs, wil not admit of neceſſary medicaments, 'tis made hard to cure.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If alſo a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaver, or conſumption, or other grievous ſymptom, or diſeaſe be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which may hinder the cure, the diſeaſe cannot eaſily be removed, as was ſaid even now, of a hot diſtemper of the liver, and of the whol body.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If there appear in the joynts, callous, Schirrous, and hard tumors, and thoſe commonly called gummoſities, the evil is hard to be cured, and is not rooted out, by moſt powerful remedies: for ſuch tumors never appear, unleſs the evil be inveterate, and hath taken deep root, moſt of which are ſixt in the bones under them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Buboes in the groins if they be hard, and are not eaſily ſuppurated, and thoſe which ſomtimes break forth, ſometimes vaniſh, are hard of cure, becauſe they ſignifie a ſtubborn matter, and a weakeneſs of nature in expelling it: but if they be eaſily ſupputated, and the ſtrength be firm, and eſpecially the liver ſtrong, they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37365:16"/>of a more benigne Diſeaſe and matter; and ſuch Buboes, if they be kept open along while, may bring perfect health.</p>
               <p n="11">11. A roughneſs of the jaws which is attended with hoarſneſs, or an obſcure, or no voice, do ſhew the evil to be antient and ſtubborn, and which wil ſcarce be cured.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Ulcers that are new in the Yard are eaſily Cured, but in the Arſehole, or about it, made difficultly, for they ſhew the evil is now inveterate: and ſuch Ulcers are continually moiſtned by the Excrements, and Medicines cannot conveniently enough be applied to them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Ulcers alſo in the joynts and other parts are moſt hard to cure, becauſe they ſignifie an evil now inveterate, and which hath invaded the whole body.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Ulcers in the mouth and jaws are not eaſily cured, becauſe alſo they argue the evil to be ancient, neither can convenient Medicines be applied to them, and they are continually moiſtned, by the Excrements falling from the brain.</p>
               <p n="15">15. If the bones of the noſe be eaten, and there be alſo a ſlow Feaver, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies an evil incurable, whenas now the diſeaſe is communicated to the brain it ſelf, or its Membranes.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Bunchings cut in this diſeaſe, eſpecially the broader, are not eaſily cured, and they argue an evil hard to be cured.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The colour of the Skin depraved, and the falling of the hair, if convenient means be applied, are not very hard to cure.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Pains eſpecially in the Head, and upon the Shins, are oftentimes very ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, that they yeild to no Remedies, or at leaſt not under a long time.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Vertigoes and falling ſickneſſes are moſt grievous and pertinacious, for they ſhew that the Veneral Virulency, hath now poſſeſt the brain it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Diſtillations alſo are laſting, becauſe they alſo happen, only when the evil is inveterate, and the brain is affected; the which are more dangerous and grievous, if they fal on the breaſt and Lungs, and exulcerate them.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Alſo the noiſe in the Ears is for the moſt part laſting, and ſcarcely removed, whenas there are divers windings in the Eares, and their expulſive faculty is weak, neither can medicines penetrate thither.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The running of the Reins alſo for the moſt part is laſting, or if it be ſtopt grievous evils are wont to follow, and moſt heavy pains of the Head and Joynts.</p>
               <p n="23">23. But chiefly the Nature of the Contagion it ſelf, from which the ſick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the diſeaſe, doth manifeſt the force and greatneſs of the diſeaſe; for this poyſon hath ſomtimes a greater, ſomtimes a leſs activity, and Phyſitians do relate who have often had ſuch Patients in cure, that ſomtimes of ten ſtrong yong men, who have had to do with the ſame Whore, not one of them hath ſcaped, therefore if it be known, from what he or ſhe, this evil was contracted, the Phyſitian may the eaſier judg of the event of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Other things being alike, this evil is eaſieſt cured, which is contracted by Whoriſh Copulation, but that is harder to Cure, which the Infant hath ſucked in with the milk, whenas the virulency goes into the ſtomach with the milk, and hence in the Liver there is generated a virulent blood, which afterwards runs through the whol body, and Pollutes that. But the Hereditary evil is hardeſt of al to Cure, and that which is communicated from infected Parents, with the Seed and blood.</p>
               <p n="25">25. As for the parts affected, if the Liver only be affected, the evil is the eaſier Cured, whenas it hath a ſtrong expulſive faculty, and Medicaments can eaſily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate unto it: but the Spleen, Kidneys, Womb, and external joynts are not ſo eaſily Cured, but hardeſt of all the Brain, and the Lungs, becauſe they have a weaker expulſive faculty, and Medicaments do not eaſily penetrate thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="26">26. From al which 'tis eaſily collected, what wil be the event of the Diſeaſe, for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37365:16"/>by how much the more, and more grievous diſeaſes and Symptomes are joyned with the Veneral diſeaſe, by ſo much the more the ſick are indangered; by how much the fewer, and lighter, by ſo much the leſs: and thoſe chiefly die, who to their putrid and Malignant Veneral Diſeaſe, have ſupervenient thoſe Feavers they call Gallical; for the Veneral Virulency whiles it corrupts the Humors, and induceth a Malignant quality into them, makes the Feaver worſe, and alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitates the innate heat, whence neither the Feaver, nor that Malignant diſeaſe can be overcome by Nature.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Very many alſo die of a waſting of the body, and a hectick Feaver, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſlow, and putrid one: for both the Veneral virulency it ſelf, and the pains, watchings, and other ſymptomes do debilitate the innate heat, hurt nutrition, whence follows a waſting of the whol body, to which is joyned a ſlow putrid Feaver raiſed from the evil Humors.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Sanguification alſo being hurt, ſome die of a Dropſie.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Many alſo die by reaſon of Catarrhes, falling down on the jaws and Lungs, hindering and taking away their breath; or the Veſſels of the Lungs being eaten by a ſharp Catarrhe, and firſt of al ſpitting of blood being raiſed, then a Phthiſick, they die.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Somtimes the Veſſels being eaten in two by the acrimony of the Humors, and Vomiting of blood cauſed, the ſick die by too great a Flux to the ſtool, or by the Womb.</p>

<note place="margin">Prevention</note> ſome Phyſitians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to teach, by what means one may keep himſelf clear, though he have had to do with an infected Woman. Of which buſineſs <hi>Fallopius</hi> treats in the whol Chapter, 89. <hi>de Morb.

But indeed I do not beleeve, that thoſe things can be taught with a good conſcience, by which ſo many men are encouraged to luſt, whom perhaps the fear of this Diſeaſe might have frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it; and therefore we wil ſay nothing of theſe Medicines; but <hi>Aurelius Minadous</hi> thinks they themſelves are deceived, that teach ſuch things, <hi>Cap.</hi> 31. <hi>de Virulentia Venerea.</hi> Where he overthrows <hi>Fallopius</hi> foundation, who thinks that this Diſeaſe is only communicated by the leaſt purulent bodies, which if they be wiped away, extracted, diſſipated, this Diſeaſe may be turned off, and he teacheth that the Contagion doth not only enter by the external parts of the Privities, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo chiefly by the internal, and runs through the Body, and that the infected Vapors, and ſpirits do paſs through the internal poroſities, and are admitted by the Veins; and therefore no man can promiſe himſelf health and ſafety from waſhing, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaches to the external parts, nor from other Medicaments outwardly applied, neither can ſuch external Medicaments take away the Pollution conceived within. The ſafect way therefore to avoid this Diſeaſe is to abſtain from whores, and to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37365:17"/>remember that Whoremongers and Adulterers the Lord wil judg, who yet is wont alſo to puniſh them in this Life, with that moſt filthy Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Jul.

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of Indications.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THoſe Indications which are in other diſeaſes,
<note place="margin">Indications</note> are found alſo in this; to wit, That which is taken from the Diſeaſe, called in ſpecy Curative: That which the cauſe doth afford, Preſervatory, whether alſo are referred urgent Symptomes; and laſt of al the Vital, for they deſervedly challenge a place in this diſeaſe, yet in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of them Authors vary much, and as every one thinks of the Nature of this Diſeaſe, ſo alſo he teacheth concerning its indication and cure. We inſiſting on thoſe things which we have formerly prepoſed of the Nature of this Diſeaſe, and have ſtrongly proved, think thus of indications in this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt of al, whenas this Diſeaſe is occult, and Malignant, chief enemy to the Liver and nutritive faculty, therefore it affords a kind of genercial indication, but no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical and profitable one can be had from thence, and therefore only experience, which hath found out Medicines working by an occult quality, hath adminiſtred profitable Medicines in this Diſeaſe: and unleſs the Spaniards had received from the Indians ſuch Medicaments, as Lignum Sanctum, Sarſapartilla, China Root; and the boldneſs of Ciyrurgions, and eſpecially <hi>Jacob Carpus,</hi> had not fallen upon the uſe of Mercury, either by chance or by argumentation, whiles they read that <hi>Avicen, Meſue,</hi> and <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> made uſe of quickſilver, in certain puſtles, and a cruſty Scab, perhaps even to this day the true Remedies of this Diſeaſe would lie hid. But though the Remedies of this diſeaſe, were not found out ſo much by indication, as by experience; yet a Method in curing of it is not wholly excluded, but hath its
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37365:17"/>place alſo, whenas 'tis neceſſary that thoſe Medicaments found out by experience be rightly applied; and beſides alſo Tumors, Ulcers, and the like Diſeaſes ſpringing from the corruption of Humors, have their Method, by which they are cured. Yet in this caſe we muſt have a care, that we do not look more on the manifeſt qualities, and known diſeaſes, than on the occult Nature of the diſeaſe, in which buſineſs not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding many do fail, who are tedious in curing of divers diſtempers, preparing the Humors, and directing their cure to theſe or thoſe diſeaſes. Whenas yet 'tis plain by experience, that in a hot, and in a dry diſtemper, and in an exuſtion of the Humors, as they ſpeak, and in a Conſumption it ſelf, we do moſt happily uſe pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and the like hot and dry things, and the Malignity being overcome, the reſt do eaſily vaniſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as concerning indication preſervatory,
<note place="margin">Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</note> here we muſt chiefly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto that Malignity and virulency imprinted on the Humors, and that is to be deſtroyed by proper and Alexipharmacal Medicines. Yet if there be any other faults in the Humors, it wil not be unprofitable alſo to mend them. And whenas the body is either burthened with a Plenitude, or abounds with vitious Humors, the malignity is the eaſier diſſeminated into it, and there is more plentiful matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for putrefaction, and the force of the Alexipharmacal means is dulled, it is expedient to empty either the ſuperfluous blood, or the vitious Humors, that the other Medicines afterwards may be adminiſtred more ſafely, more commodiouſly, and with greater benefit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Diſeaſe and various Symptomes,
<note place="margin">Curative.</note> which ſupervene to the principal diſeaſe, and ariſe from the corruption of Humors, are al to be removed in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per manner.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſtrength is to be preſerved, for as no other diſeaſe can be cured,
<note place="margin">Vital.</note> unleſs there be ſtrength of body, ſo nor this; and al attempts are in vain, unleſs at leaſtwiſe we have Nature willing.</p>
               <p>And ſo there are four things chiefly to be done in this diſeaſe: Firſt of al,
<note place="margin">Four things to be done in the Cure of the Veneral diſeaſe.</note> if blood abound, that muſt be diminiſht, and if any vitious Humors abound, they are to be prepared and emptied, and if there be any manifeſt diſeaſes, which may be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the proper Cure, as obſtructions and the like, they muſt firſt of all be taken away. Secondly, the Malignity and virulency as wel that inherent in the humors, as that imprinted on the parts, and principally the Liver, is to be deſtroied by the proper Alexipharmaca of this diſeaſe. Thirdly, the ſtrength is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and confirmed, and firſt of al chiefe care is to be had of the Liver, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in this diſeaſe. Fourthly, the diſeaſes and Symptomes which are wont to be joyned to this diſeaſe are to be taken away.</p>
               <p>Here we muſt clear a controverſie, to wit,
<note place="margin">Whether the cure may be perfected without ſweating.</note> Whether this diſeaſe may be cured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſweating? Some are of this opinion, That this diſeaſe may be taken away, though ſweat be not provoked: And firſt of al they prove it thus, Becauſe this evil conſiſts in a certain hidden quality which cannot be taken away but by alteration of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whenas contraries are cured by contraries: but that alteration may be affected by the proper vertue of antidotes and decoctious adminiſtred, without ſweating. Next of al they alledge experience, by which it is evident, that by the taking of ſuch Medicaments, ſome have recovered without ſweating. Thirdly, they urge this, That thoſe that drink the decoction of the wood are ſomtimes happily emptied by nature, by urine, by the ſtool, and not alwaies by ſweats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurelius Minadous,</hi> contends againſt theſe, <hi>de Virulen. Vener. Cap.</hi> 39. And firſt of al he writes that he never obſerved, that Phyſitians commanded the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be taken without ſweating, to which al Alexipharmacal things of their own Nature do incline men, neither is the matter it ſelf unfit to be expeld this way, being Vaporous and halituous: neither was there ever any one, who did throughly and wholly overcome this diſeaſe without the help of ſome ſweating, eſpecially if it were inveterate; but why he holds thus, he brings this reaſon, That in his opinion, the eſſence of this evil doth not conſiſt in a quality, but in the body
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37365:18"/>affected with an evil quality: and therefore he holds, as a quality doth indicate alteration, ſo a body indicates Evacuation, which though it may be many waies, yet moſt commodiouſly by ſweating: whenas this very thing is a Vaporous body, and is moſt rightly and eaſily diſcuſſed by ſweat; and he adds this, whenas there is a great quantity of Excrements abounding in thoſe bodies infected with this diſeaſe, not only in one part, but al over the body; but ſweat is an univerſal Evacuation, they are moſt commodiouſly emptied by ſweating: and he holds that ſweats do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much profit the Liver eſpecially. For whenas that is the Forge of Humors, which are carried through the whol body, and they are purged by the benefit of ſweat, and freed from al defilements, alſo the Liver polluted may be this way clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and though Nature ſomtimes do empty the virulent humors by ſome other part, as by ſtool, or by Urine, and then her endeavor is not to be hindered, but to be helped forward; yet he holds that without ſweating the whol body cannot be freed from that Diſeaſe, and he thinks that ſweat only can empty from al places both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and external, quickly, ſafely, and pleaſantly.</p>
               <p>But neither of theſe opinions doth fully reach the Truth,
<note place="margin">The deciſion</note> and both delivers an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Cure. For whenas the Curative indication ſo called in general, is twofold; the one preſervative, which is taken from the cauſe; the other in ſpecy called Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which is taken from the Diſeaſe; they who think this diſeaſe may be cured without ſweat, becauſe it conſiſts in a certain hidden and Malignant quality, think right concerning the curative indication, whenas that malignant quality cannot be taken away by ſweating, or other Evacuations, but by proper Alexipharmaca, yet they neglect the preſervative indication, and the cauſe: for whenas it is certain, that in the Veneral diſeaſe, there is not only a vitious diſpoſition, and Malignant, in the parts, eſpecially the Liver, but that al the Humors of the Body are corrupted; there is required then an Evacuation of them, which is moſt commodiouſly done by ſweating, as <hi>Minadous</hi> rightly proves. For though ſomthing be diſcuſſed inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, yet that inſenſible Evacuation is not ſufficient, and 'tis too ſlow. But <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius Minadous,</hi> thinks wel concerning the taking away of the Cauſe, and the Evacuation of vitious Humors, which is moſt rightly done by ſweating; but he neglects the diſeaſe it ſelf, or that Malignant quality, imprinted nor only on the Humors, but alſo on the Living parts: from which it appears, which is diligently to be taken notice of, that the diſpute of occult diſeaſes, is not amongſt thoſe which <hi>Galen</hi> calls Logical, but does conceive the very eſſence of theſe diſeaſes, and that the ignorance of the occult diſeaſes, doth not only breed Errors in theory, but alſo in pactice. Therefore though we do grant, that the Evacuation of Humors is wel ordered by ſweating, yet Alexipharmaca are neceſſary alſo, againſt that malignant diſpoſition in the parts, eſpecially in the Liver, and <hi>Fernelius,</hi> whom <hi>Palmarius</hi> follows, or this very cauſe do add peculiar Alexipharmaca, as ſhal be ſaid, that that Malignant diſpoſition may be pulled up by the Routs. For though al the vicious Humors be emptied, and al other diſeaſes and Symptomes do ceaſe after their emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying; yet unleſs that Malignant diſpoſition be taken out of the parts, the evil grows freſh again, and oftentimes a long while after. And this I think is the cauſe, that not only the decoction of Pockwood, Sarſaparilla, and the like, is given in the morning to provoke ſweat, but alſo without ſweating is taken as common drink; for the very ſame proper Medicines, which do deſtroy the occult cauſe and malignity in the humors, and do empty the vitious humors by ſweat, are able alſo to Eradicate the diſpoſition imprinted in the parts.</p>
               <p>Laſt, of al this muſt not be paſt over, that the indications propoſed before, are not neceſſary to be obſerved in every French diſeaſe, but only in that, which hath almoſt invaded the whol body, and eſpecially hath poſſeſſed the Liver. But if the evil be new, there is no need either to let blood, or to give purges, whenas the fault is not yet communicated to the humors, but it is enough to wipe off, or cal forth the contagion received, which alſo is ſufficient in the ſcab newly contracted by contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where yet we muſt obſerve, whether thoſe puſtles, and French rottenneſs, as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37365:18"/>they cal it, do immediately proceed from contagion, and whoriſh copulation, for then external medicines do ſuffice, or whether they do ariſe from the Liver now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, for then there is need of evacuations and alexipharmaca.</p>

               <p>FIrſt of al therefore as concerning indication preſervative, or the removing of the cauſes, and bleeding at the beginning; truly the cauſe of this diſeaſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and next of al is not taken away by letting of blood; yet if blood do abound in the body, and that eſpecially be too hot, the proper remedies of this diſeaſe, which are hot and dry, cannot be ſafely adminiſtred unleſs the abounding blood be firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed.</p>
               <p>And truly if the virulent matter have no peculiar motion to any part, the baſilick veine may firſt of al be opened: but if the matter have motion to ſome particular part, as to the groin, and nature thruſt forth a bubo, bleeding is warily to be uſed: for if the bubo tend to ſuppuration, we muſt not let blood, and eſpecially in the Arme, leſt nature be troubled in her expulſion, and the matter be recalled to the inward parts. And it hath been obſerved, that many from the bubo opened, and the matter a long while emptied by it, have become perfectly found; on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from unſeaſonable bleeding, the evil hath been prolonged; therefore in bleeding we muſt attend the motion of nature, and when the tumor doth not afford hopes of ſuppuration, a veine muſt be opened in the lower parts, for ſo the the matter is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted towards the lower parts, and by reaſon of the efflux of hot blood, 'tis after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more eaſily ſuppurated. After the ſame manner a veine is to be opened in the yard, if there be rottenneſs in the privities, or a running of the Reines, and wholly if the parts below the Liver be affected: but if the matter ruſh to the head, and there cauſe moſt vehement pains, filthy ulcers, falling of the haire, the cephalick veine in the Arme is moſt commonly opened.</p>
               <p>The other precepts which are propounded in general concerning the right admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration in bleeding, are here alſo to be obſerved; which whenas they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this affect, we ſhal no further propoſe them here.</p>
               <p>If the ſtrength wil not beare bleeding, inſtead thereof the hemorhoidal veines of the Arſe, may be opened, or Cupping-glaſſes be applied in convenient places.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NExt of al if the body be cacochymical,
<note place="margin">Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purging of humors.</note> the vitious humors muſt be emptied and prepared with convenient medicaments; whenas in an impure body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexipharmacal meanes, and proper remedies of this diſeaſe, do profit little, nay they may bring hurt, and though that diſeaſe be overcome, may tender the body obnoxious to other diſeaſes. For vitious humors collected about the bowels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not al be diſcuſſed and diſſipated by ſweat, but the thinner part being diſcuſſed the thicker is left, and grows dry, and is faſtened in the bowels, and oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting an acrimony, doth weaken the ſubſtance of the veſſels: from whence that diſeaſe grows ſomtimes more ſtubborn to cure, and there ariſe obſtructions of the Liver and Spleen, and ſchirrous tumors, hypochondriacal diſeaſes, and creeping ulcers.</p>
               <p>Nor yet is purging only to be uſed in the beginning, and before the proper cure of the diſeaſe, but alſo the whol time of the cure, if vitious matter be collected again,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37365:19"/>'tis to be emptied by intervals: yet if the evil be now inveterate, and ſtick princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in the external parts, the vitious matter is not raſhly to be recalled to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts by ſtrong purgers, leaſt the Liver, Stomach, and other bowels be hurt and weakned, but 'tis to be emptied by convenient places, where nature tends.</p>
               <p>But concerning the preparation and purging of humors, though many Authors are large enough, yet whenas thoſe things which are ſpoke by them, concerning an univerſal preparation and purging of humors, are not proper to this diſeaſe, but are common to al depending on a cacochymy: it ſeems not worth our labor, to dwel upon thoſe generals, which are already known by the cure of many other diſeaſes. We ſhal only admoniſh you of theſe things; firſt of al when the diſeaſe is new, we muſt obſerve, what vitious humors abound in the body, and eſpecially in the ſecond region, and thoſe muſt be prepared and emptied. But if the evil be now inveterate, becauſe in that for the moſt part, thick and aduſt humors are collected, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins are firſt of al to be directed againſt them. Next of al this is to be obſerved, that we have reſpect alſo to the diſtemper of the bowels, and if they have contracted any diſtemper, that muſt be corrected, and they muſt be ſtrengthened with proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments. Thirdly, it is neceſſary, that we alwaies ad ſomwhat to our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and purgers, which doth reſiſt the Veneral virulency by a ſpecifick faculty; and therefore concerning common purging medicines we wilad nothing, whenas they are every where obvious and known, but this that many phyſitians do teſtify, That Mechcacan, to which belongs Jallop, is given not only for its purging faculty with benefit in this diſeaſe, but alſo becauſe 'tis an enemy to this evil by a peculiar power, ſo that it is numbered by ſome amongſt the antidotes of this diſeaſe.

               </head>
               <p>AFter the body is emptied in convenient manner, the greateſt hopes of this cure is in the proper antidotes of this diſeaſe, as from which only perfect health can be hoped for ſo indeed, that though divers other diſeaſes, ariſing from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humors, be often joined with this diſeaſe; yet if that malignity be taken away, a little while after either they vaniſh of their own accord, or are eaſily cured, but without the help of theſe remedies, no perfect cure can be hoped for by other medicines, under what name ſoever: and this too is obſerved by many that theſe kind of medicaments though by their manifeſt qualities they ſeem to be adverſaries to a hot and dry diſtemper, yet theſe hot and dry medicaments have been uſed with moſt happy ſucceſs by many who were endewed with a hot and dry diſtemper of the Liver, nay of the whol body, and who had a leane habit of body, nay were almoſt plainly conſumptive, from which very thing appeares, that in this diſeaſe, we ought rather to take care of the occult malignity, than of the manifeſt diſtemper. And therefore as ſoon as the body is in ſome ſort prepared and emptied, we muſt maturely haſten to thoſe Alexipharmaca of the Veneral diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>But though ſome Phyſitians would advance and extol the vertues of thoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments which ſhal preſently be reckoned up,
<note place="margin">Alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maca of the Veneral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> whiles they hold, that the decoction of Juniper wood, of the Olive tree, Box, Beech, and other trees may performe the ſame, as the decoction of Guajacum, ſo that a moſt ſlender courſe of dyet be uſed, as is wont to be obſerved with the decoction of Pock-wood: yet experience hath long ſince taught that that is falſe: for though it be certain that by a moſt ſlender diet ſome ſymptomes of this diſeaſe do grow more gentle, yet unleſs proper reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be adminiſtred, a little while after the diſeaſe is ſeen to grow freſh again, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37365:19"/>return more cruel: for ſuch medicines indeed with a ſlender diet, may conſume the vitious humors, but they cannot overcome the malignity: as therefore this diſeaſe is occult, and is not known but by its effects, ſo alſo the remedies which cure this diſeaſe, are not found out by reaſon, but only by experience.</p>
               <p>But what thoſe medicaments are, Phyſitians again do not fully agree.
<note place="margin">What they are.</note> Many put their greateſt hopes in Quickſilver, and think that the only and proper Alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macum of the Veneral diſeaſe; others do wholy reject it, of which buſineſs ſhal be ſpoke hereafter. Others, and moſt men indeed, undertake the cure of this diſeaſe with the uſe of Guajacum, Sarſaparilla, China root, Saſſafras wood; and others doubt of theſe very things, nay ſome deny that this diſeaſe can be overcome by the uſe of Guajacum only and the like, and therefore they think their vertue ought to be quickned and increaſed by the mixture of other things. <hi>Jul. Palmarius lib. de lue Vener. cap.</hi> 13. diſtinguiſheth and thinks that Guajacum is not of ſo great force that that alone can wholy extinguiſh the root, and al the deadlineſs of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral poyſon; neither that it is ſo weak, that it can do nothing without the help and conjunction of other things; he writes indeed that by the uſe of that alone, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors being conſumed, al the ſymptomes of the diſeaſe wil at length be allaied, and wholly lie hid, but yet the virulent taint of the diſeaſe, which is already in the ſolid parts, is not overcome, and wholy extinguiſhed in moſt people by that remedy; but that the deadlineſs of the latent poyſon be wholy extinguiſht, and that the return of the diſeaſe be prevented, he thinks other alexipharmaca ought to be adminiſtred, which opinion doubtleſs he received from his Maſter <hi>Fernelius,</hi> for he writes that he, as in <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de. lue Vener. cap.</hi> 7. did firſt dare to promiſe a perfect cure of the French Diſeaſe without the uſe of Quick-ſilver, and that he took care for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of many Alexipharmaca at his Houſe, which he gave againſt this poyſon with Guajacum, and ſomtimes without it, and as he writes in the alleaged <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. two of theſe medicines which he found to be moſt excellent and efficacious, he by the addition of other medicines hath reduced into one, which hitherto never failed any man.</p>
               <p>But whenas theſe medicaments are compounded of common Alexpharmaca not proper to this diſeaſe, we ſhal not propoſe them in the firſt place, but hereafter we ſhal ſpeak ſomwhat of them.

               <p>Amongſt other new Iſlands found out in former Ages, there is one alſo, which the Spaniards the diſcoverers have called by the name of <hi>Hiſpaniola:</hi> whenas the Veneral diſeaſe was reported to be indemious there, and the decoction of a certain wood is eſteemed there the only remedy of that diſeaſe, which at this day is called guajacum, &amp; by the inhabitants is pronounced with gaping Huajacum. The Spaniards infected with the ſame diſeaſe, having found the ſame decoction to be helpful, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſcover its vertue to others: the tree is reported to be leaved like aſh, the color of the wood within is blackiſh, the wood it ſelf is heavy and ponderous, it floates not in water, but ſinks; 'tis ful of rozin, and while it burnes, it ſends forth no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful ſcent, its taſt is ſomewhat bitter, with a light accrimony, pricking the tongue.</p>
               <p>There is ſome doubt amongſt phyſitians concerning the choice of it;
<note place="margin">The Choice of Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> ſome are of opinion, that which is whitiſh, is to be preferred before the reſt; whenas by how much the leſſer 'tis in years, by ſo much the whiter it is, but the older it is, by ſo much the blacker it is: but that which is older is dryer, and that which is yonger is more moiſt, and more abounding with juyce, and therefore more powerful. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whenas there is a two fould humor in living things, the one primogenious, the ſubject of innate heate, or the implanted ſpirit, apt to take fire; the other alimentary, more watriſh, and leſs apt to be ſet on fire: the vertues of this wood, as alſo of other plants, are not to be judged from the alimentary and more watriſh humor, but from that implanted heat, and primogenious humidity; which whenas in 'its tender age, both in infants, and in plants, 'tis overwhelmed and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by much moiſture, many actions in that age are infirm and weak, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that moiſture being ſomewhat waſted, and the heat become more vigorous, in progreſs of time they become more ſtrong, and this heat the cheif inſtrument ofal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is wont to conſiſt unchanged til it comes to its ful age, and heigth: and therefore though the ſame innate heat and radical moiſture be alwaies in Guajacum, on which its vertues do depend, yet becauſe in the yong and tender wood, that vertue is as it were over whelmed, and reſtrained by the abundance of moiſture, that wood which is the yonger is leſs efficacious, than that which is now of a ful confirmed growth: and therefore for the cure of this diſeaſe, we muſt not chuſe that wood which is yellowiſh, or that is of a box colour, or that which is cut of a tree not ful grown, or from the boughs, as being leſs efficacious; but rather that which is ſomewhat black, becauſe that is more roziny, and abounds with that fat and balſomy ſubſtance,
<note place="margin">How the age of this wood is to be diſcerned</note> in which doth chiefly reſide that vertue oppoſite to veneral virulency. It is good therefore to know the age of this wood, that we may chooſe the moſt effectual. For that indeed which hath the inward part black, and is long waies divided with clefts as it were with certain lines of a duskiſh colour, gathered into blackiſh rounds, that is efficacious, but yet 'tis ſuch as is cut off either from the arms of trees, or certainly hath not yet attained its ful maturity, and therefore 'tis of leſs efficacy: for thoſe kind of Lines do therefore appeare becauſe that fatty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which doth chiefly reſide in the middle trunk of the tree, is not yet ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, as to fil up al the internal parts of the wood: but that which is black al over the internal parts, the ſuperficies only being whitiſh, that if it be ſound, weighty, and odorous, and prick the tongue with a light acrimony, and either is not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with any lines, or elſe with thoſe ful of rozin, and therefore while it burnes beſides the grateful ſmel it ſends forth, it alſo yeelds a blackiſh rozin that hath attained the higheſt degree of maturity, and is cut off from the body of the tree, and is therfore moſt effectual, but if it be divided with lines, and ful of holes, and neither weighty, nor odorous, nor acrimonious, and being lighted yeelds no rozin, it is a ſign that that is now old, and therefore its vertues are grown dul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L. Septalius</hi> alſo doth admoniſh us here, that there is a certain ſort of Guajacum, which is never to be brought into uſe, which hath no true blackneſs in the middle of it, but is of a ſomewhat darke and greeniſh colour, which makes the decoction very thick, that it wil never be cleare, and by its exceeding acrimony, it cauſeth a heat
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37365:20"/>both in the throat and jaws, and by reaſon of its thick and earthy parts, for the moſt part it cauſeth obſtructions in the ſpleen, ſometimes alſo in the liver, Empiricks cal it the wild holy wood: but whereas he finds no where in Authors this twofould difference of domeſtick, and wild; he rather thinks it acquires theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities from the nature of the ſoil.</p>
               <p>Alſo if the barke be thick, and cleave ſo to the wood, that it can ſcarce be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and parted from it, the wood is good: but if the Bark be eaſily ſeparated from the wood, either 'tis old, or periſht by ſalt water: alſo if the wood appear fatty whiles it is raſped, and that being maſticated doth bite, and leave a bitterneſs behind it; and whiles it is cut, it appeare ſolid with an even ſuperficies, not rough and ful of holes, the wood is good.</p>
               <p>The Bark of this wood is endewed with great acrimony and bitterneſs,
<note place="margin">The bark of Guajacum.</note> and therefore dries, attenuates, and digeſts more powerfully than the wood; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that occult vertue which is oppoſite to this diſeaſe, is rather in that fatty and moiſt, and balſamical ſubſtance, the wood is alwaies preferred before the bark; and beſides the bark is not ſo conveniently given in hot and dry bodies.</p>
               <p>As concerning the vertues of Guajacum, it is hot and dry, as may be perceived from its taſt, ſmel, and acrimony, and that in the ſecond degree,
<note place="margin">The vertues of Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> and 'tis alſo of thin parts, whence it hath power to attenuate craſs things, to cut and cleanſe clammy humors, to open obſtructions, to move ſweat and urine, and to diſſipate and waſt ſuperfluous cold humors: but this pockwood is not chiefly given for thoſe qualities (whenas there are found in <hi>Europe</hi> medicaments endewed with thoſe qualities, that there was no need to tranſport them out of the <hi>Indies</hi>) but principally for that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and occult power. By which it is oppoſed to the Veneral virulency: and truly al phyſitians almoſt doe agree that pockwood doth deſerve the firſt place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the alexiplarmaca of the veneral diſeaſe: for though <hi>Fernelius</hi> would ſomewhat leſſen its vertue, becauſe al that are affected with this diſeaſe are not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the uſe of it, yet this is no ſufficient cauſe, ſince there is found no ſuch alexipharmacum, or other medicine which can cure diſeaſes paſt hope. But this wood is by an occult quality and propriety oppoſite to the Veneral viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency it ſelf, and is a friend to the radical moiſture, and natural balſom, which doth moſt of al ſuffer by this virulency inimicous to the nutritive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; and doth ſo ſtrengthen it, that it hath been obſerved, that thoſe alſo, who had a liver, and whol habit of body hot and dry, and who have been almoſt conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the veneral diſeaſe, as was ſaid before, by the uſe of the decoction of this wood, though by its heat and dryneſs adverſe to them have been reſtored, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better habited and more corpulent. Some indeed have dared to write, that the decoction of this wood doth nouriſh as much as chicken broath: but theſe ſeem to me, to be exceſſive in the praiſe of this wood: for though it be a vegetable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may leave ſome alimental juyce in the decoction, yet I think no body that is in his right mind wil eaſily deny, that a chicken hath not more convenient nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a man, than Guajacum,
<note place="margin">Whether pock-wood do nouriſh.</note> but that ſome after this diſeaſe become more corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, is accidental; for whenas by reaſon of the Veneral virulency nutrition was hurt in the whol body, when that is diſcuſſed and extinguiſht, the body begins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be nouriſht wel, and to be augmented: the like of which happens alſo in ſome other diſeaſes, eſpecially in feavers, before which whenas men were not wel fleſht by reaſon of evil nouriſhment, the vitious humors being waiſted by the diſeaſe afterwards they begin to be nouriſht wel, and become more corpulent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fr. Arcaeus</hi> alſo <hi>lib. de curand. vulner. rat.</hi> gives the

The ſame vertues alſo others do attribute,

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37365:21"/>the ptiſick, Veneral diſeaſe, ſcab and other diſeaſes, bodies extenuated, have been reſtored again, and made fat by the uſe of theſe decoctions, yet this comes to paſs not of it ſelf, becauſe theſe decoctions have a nutritive faculty, as other nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhments, but by accident, in as much as they take away the cauſe of leanneſs. In ptiſick bodies the caſe is plain; for whenas that waſting of the body proceeds from an ulcer of the Lungs, the ulcer being dried up by the uſe of Guajacum, the body begins to be wel nouriſht again: the ſame happens in other diſeaſes, as the French, the Scab, and the like. For whenas that leanneſs, and conſumption doth proceed from bad nouriſhment, but bad nouriſhment for the moſt part from acrid and falt humors, which do both conſume the good blood, and hinder the agglutination of it to the body, thoſe vitious humors being waſted by the decoctions, and diſcuſſed by ſweats, the bodies begin to be nouriſht wel again, nay grow fat.</p>
               <p>But this wood hath not only an alterative power, and by its occult quality to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh that malignity of the Veneral virulency, imprinted both on the humors, and the ſolid parts, but alſo to evacuate, both ſenſibly by ſweating, and inſenſibly by inſenſible tranſpiration: and therefore the way of curing the French diſeaſe by Guajacum, and medicines of affinity with that is moſt in uſe. For though by reaſon of the length of the cure, and the pains of ſweating, and the ſlender dyet, it cauſe ſome trouble to them: yet it is far ſafer than that way, which is by quickſilver, where if there be an error, the patient is in no ſmal danger.</p>
               <p>But there are prepared out of Guajacum divers medicaments,
<note place="margin">Medicines made out of Guajacum.</note> and thoſe either in a liquid forme, or in a ſolid, and in ſubſtance: but thoſe given in a liquid forme, are moſt effectual, whenas they are eaſily deduced into act and penetrate into the whol body, and do irritae the expulſive faculty of al parts to caſt off what is hurtful: but in a ſolid forme, whenas that part in which the vertue of the medicine doth chiefly reſide, is not yet ſeparated from the earthy and thick part, 'tis not ſo eaſily deduced into act. The decoction therefore as moſt convenient is moſt in uſe: yet if any by reaſon of the continued uſe of this medicine be weary of it, and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs do feare leaſt there be ſome reliques of the evil humor remaining, or their courſe of life wil no longer admit of the uſe of the decoction as it ought to be taken, to ſuch, medicines made out of this wood, may be given in another form. Amongſt which extracts and ſpirits, as ſhal be ſaid, are moſt efficacious, and far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than pouders.</p>
               <p>But the manner of boy ling this wood is various,
<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the wood. Whether it ought to be boyled in Wine.</note> both in reſpect of the liquor in which the decoction is made, and of the quality of the liquor: for ſome boyl the wood in water, ſome in Barly water, ſome in diſtilled waters, others in wine, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Whey, and others in broth of Fleſh. <hi>L. Septalius lib. 7. adnimadu. nu.</hi> 204. reprehends thoſe who deny, that the decoction of this wood may be made in wine only, when as nothing is more fit to extract the faculties of medicines, than wine, and the water of wine (he had ſpoke righter than the ſpirit of wine) and therefore he prepares his decoction with wine, which he uſeth when the diſeaſe is inveterate with an evil habit of body, and a cold matter predominant: after this manner eight ounces of the bark of the beſt holy wood groſſely poudered being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in forty two phyſical pints of the beſt white wine, for two days, the wine being firſt heated and alwaies kept hot thoſe two days in a double veſſel, or in the aſhes; afterwards with a ſlow fire boyl it away in a double veſſel, to the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the third part, which let the ſick make uſe of, both in the morning inſtead of a ſyrup, and for his drink at meales, let him take in the morning ſeven ounces, &amp; an hour after move ſweat: but at dinner, and ſupper let him not exceed fourteen ounces. But though we grant that wine is moſt commodious to extract the vertues of vegetables, yet this cannot be denied that by boyling the ſtrength of wine doth vaniſh, and when the ſpirit is exhaled, there is left a nauſeous phlegme leſs profitable than plain ſimple water. And therefore I am of that opinion that either the wood is to be boyled in water, and towards the end, the wine is to be added, or elſe the wood
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37365:21"/>is only to be a long while infuſed in wine, or to be boyled in a double veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, that nothing be loſt, but by no means to the Conſumption of the third part.</p>
               <p>Therefore moſt commonly and rightly the decoction is made in pure water, which doth both a little correct the Heat and drineſs of the Medicine, and further the diſtribution, and provocation of ſweat, yet if the body, and eſpecially the ſtomach be cold and weak, and the Patient accuſtomed to wine, Wine is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably mixt with it, as was ſaid even now, and ſhal be ſaid hereafter; for by the admiſtion of Wine the ſtomach is leſs hurt, and the vertue of the Medicine doth the eaſier penetrate to al the parts.</p>
               <p>And a different proportion of the wood to the water is obſerved according to the age, conſtitution of the body, and ſeaſon of the year,
<note place="margin">The propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wood to the water.</note> and they take to twelve pound of water, from three ounces of the wood to twelve: for if the ſeaſon of the year and the body be hot, 'tis ſafeſt, to take a leſs quantity of the wood, and in a longer time to perfect the Cure, than by too ſtrong a Medicine to damneſie the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, eſpecially at the beginning of the cure, and before the ſuperfluous Humors in the body be abated, and ſweat begin to flow eaſily and exquiſitly, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be accuſtomed to the Decoction, afterwards by degrees you may take more of the Wood, which unleſs it be obſerved, the Patient is eaſily brought into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi> writes, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Morb. occult. Cap.</hi> 13. That he hath ſeen patients who by this error, <hi>viz.</hi> too great a quantity of the wood given on the firſt daies, have fallen into a Feaver, that afterwards they have been forced to abſtaine from the uſe of the decoction, to their great detriment: but where there is no ſuch thing to be feared, in thoſe of ripe years, we commonly add to one pound of the wood raſped or turned ſmal, twelve pound of water, in an earthen Veſſel glaſed, and let it infuſe twenty four hours in a warm place, afterwards the veſſel being wel covered boyle it with a gentle fire, til half, or the third part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and let the decoction cool in this veſſel ſtil covered, afterwards ſtrain it.</p>

<note place="margin">After what manner 'tis to be boyled.</note> diſputes whether it be better to boyle it with an open fire, or in a double veſſel as was ſaid, or in Balneo Mariae, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends them who hold that the decoction made in Balneo is more dilute, or leſs powerful: and that the decoction made in Balneo, is more excellent than that which is made with an open fire, he endeavors to prove by the example of diſtilled waters, which by the balneum are made moſt excellent, when as there is no aduſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them, but the greater eliquation which is made in that hot and moiſt, doth render the decoction more excellent; but experience teacheth otherwiſe, which reaſon alſo doth confirme. For though out of ſome moiſter plants, as Roſes, Violets, Lilly of the vallies, and the like, being freſh, whoſe vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the volatile part, as the Chymiſts ſpeak, the beſt waters are made in balneo without the affuſion of water: yet in hotter plants, eſpecially in Roots and woods, whoſe vertue conſiſts in the oyly part, their vertue can never be extracted by the too gentle heat of a Balneum, as happens alſo in many ſeeds, but they muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled by a † Veſica through which by the vehicle of the water,
<note place="margin">A chymical Veſſel.</note> thoſe more fixed parts may be elevated: when as then the whol vertue of Guajacum doth conſiſt in that oyly and rozeny part, and there is need of ſtrong boyling that that may be extracted, the gentle heat of a Bolneum cannot do it, but it muſt be boyled in an open fire, which nevertheleſs cauſeth no aduſtion, if there be added a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of water.</p>
               <p>Some for the better guſt, and that the bitterneſs and acrimony may be abated, a little before 'tis boyled enough add of Raiſon and Liquoriſh, of each one ounce; and you may add Sugar, or ſome Julep to relliſh it, <hi>Aurelius Minadous, de virulen. Vener. Cap.</hi> 4. holds the Decoction ought chiefly to be Dulcorated with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37365:22"/>Honey; for he thinks that a ſmal quantity of Honey, if it be boyled with it and Skimmed, wil rebate al the bitterneſs, and the Decoction acquire a greater power to cleanſe, attenuate, open, and make fuſil the Humors, and ſtrengthen the parts: which we grant may take place in phlegmatick bodies, and eſpecially in a cold ſtomach; ſo whenas honey doth eaſily turn to Choller, we think it cannot ſafely be uſed, in chollerick bodies, hot and dry, but more conveniently and ſafely Raiſons, Liquoriſh, or Sugar.</p>
               <p>Some alſo in thoſe who have a hot and dry Liver, do add towards the end of the decoction a root or two of Succory, one or two handfuls of Endive, Sowthiſtle: but whenas ſuch decoctions are to be continued along while, we muſt have a care leaſt by the admiſtion of ſuch things they be made ingrateful, and provoke nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the Patient: beſides whenas for the moſt part there is boyled at one time Decoction enough for many daies, but the addition of ſuch Herbs doth cauſe, that the Decoction wil not laſt ſo long, to prevent this, ſuch herbs are to be added not to the whol decoction, but to about one pound of it.</p>
               <p>Some not unprofitably, eſpecially to thoſe accuſtomed to it, and whoſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is weak, do add towards the end of the decoction three pound of a ſweetiſh white wine; ſome prepare the whol decoction in wine, but not ſo rightly: for the beſt part of the wine doth evaporate in boyling, and there is left an ingrateful Flegm as was ſaid before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurelius Minadous,</hi> alſo doth admoniſh, that the decoction of the wood is to be given with a vehicle, which may direct the vertue of the Medicine to the parts principally affected; and the Head moſt of al affected we muſt mix Cephalick things; the Reins affected, things Nephtitical; the Liver, Hepatical; the Spleen, things Splenitick. Which as we do not wholly diſallow of, ſo we do not alwaies think it neceſſary, whenas the vertue of the decoction doth eaſily of it ſelf pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the whol body: but we muſt chiefly have a care, leaſt by the admiſtion of ſuch Medicines, the decoction be rendered nauſeous and ingrateful to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; which when he himſelf alſo conſiders, he admoniſheth rightly, that ſuch Medicines are more commodiouſly taken by themſelves reduced into a pouder, or Bolus, or ſome other forme, than mixt with the decoction; but we ſhal ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after of compound decoctions.</p>
               <p>The Chymiſts whenas they fear leaſt by the long boyling,
<note place="margin">Diſtilled water from Guajaum.</note> which is to the half, or a third part, the Spirituous and ſubtile parts ſhould exhale and be diſſipated, and ſo the vertue of the Medicine be diminiſhed, prepare this decoction another way, ſo that it loſeth nothing of its ſtrength, they take the pouder of Guajacum and put it into a retort, and pouring a ſufficient quantity of water, they place the retort in the aſhes, and apply the receiving veſſel, and making a fire under it, firſt they make a digeſtion, then diſtil it, to the Conſumption of one half of the water they give of the diſtilled water four ounces; yet it were moſt commodious if the diſtilled water were mixed with the reſt of the decoction in the retort being ſtrained; for ſo they would have al the vertue; to that decoction remaining in the retort may be poured more water, and let it digeſt twelve hours, afterwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil it; and the liquor diſtilled may be given for common drink, and whenas it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſomtimes, that Infants are born infected with the Veneral diſeaſe, or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by their Nurſes, this diſtilled and ſweetned with Sugar may be given them inſtead of Juleps.</p>
               <p>Alſo after that the firſt decoction prepared the common way,
<note place="margin">The ſecond decoction.</note> is ſtrained, twelve or eighteen pound of water again is poured to the wood remaining after the firſt boyling according as the Patient is wont to drink more or leſs, and is boyled to the Conſumption of the third part; and being ſtrained is given for ordinary drink at dinner and ſupper, if they deſire a more pleaſant and ſweeter drink, you may add four ounces or more of Rayſons, or inſtead of Rayſons, one ounce or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37365:22"/>two of Coriander ſeed prepared, and ſweeten the decoction with two or three ounces of Sugar.</p>
               <p>But if any Herbs have been added to the firſt decoction, the decoction for drink at meals muſt not be made of the remainders of the firſt decoction becauſe it would be nauſeous, but you muſt prepare another freſh decoction, but more dilute, or a wine of Guajacum, which is made thus:
<note place="margin">Wine of Guajacum.</note> Take four or five pound of the wood, four pound of white Sugar, ten pound of white Wine, and put the wood into a wooden Veſſel, and heat the Wine and powr it to it.</p>

<note place="margin">The third decoction.</note> the ſame decoction alſo may be uſed to waſh the hands, to clenſe the Noſtrils, and mundiſie Ulcers.</p>
               <p>And ſome give this wood other waies, ſome in the form of a pouder,
<note place="margin">An Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary of Guajacum.</note> others make electuaries of it. Thus <hi>Nicol. Maſſa. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Morb. Gal. Cap.</hi> 6. he takes of the Indian wood moſt finely prepared one pound, and with Syrup of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory boyles it to the form of an Electuary, of which he gives half an ounce or an ounce; or take of the wood of Guajacum, Sarlaparilla, finely poudered, of each one ounce, of the ſpecies of the three ſaunders and Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each two drams; Conſerve of Succory, Roſes, of each ſix ounces; with Syrup of Succory make an Electuary.</p>
               <p>Others with a convenient Syrup make pills of it.</p>
               <p>But others not without cauſe do here admoniſh us, that ſuch Medicines are leſs effectual, and that many, who were newly infected, when as they hoped for health by the uſe of ſuch Medicaments, by that delay and lingring and weakneſs of the Medicine have fallen into a moſt grievous evil: for as was ſaid, ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines do leſs penetrate into the body. Yet towards the latter end of the Cure, when the evil is almoſt overcome, and 'tis only feared, that there may remain ſome evil diſpoſition, and the long continued drinking of the decoction of the wood is nauſeous to the patient, ſuch Medicines may be uſed to conſume the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>An extract of this wood is more commodiouſly prepared, and out of that pills,
<note place="margin">An extract of Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> or rowles: but after the uſe of it there is need of taking ſome liquor, by whoſe vehicle the extract may be diſtributed and carried into the whol body: nay theſe extracts, according to the opinion of <hi>Hercules Saxonia,</hi> have ſcarce ſo great ſtrength as to overcome this diſeaſe if it be very great and ancient, but the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is deſervedly preferred before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hercules Saxonia de lue Vener. cap.</hi> 27. writes that the oyl is ſtronger,
<note place="margin">The oyl of Guajacnm.</note> and he thinks the whol Alexipharmacal power of the wood is placed in this Oyl, and he relates that he hath proved by experience, that by the benefit of this oyl; the greateſt and ancienteſt diſeaſe hath been overcome. But he gives it divers waies, in waſted bodies with milk, in others of a hotter temperament, with Conſerve of Roſes, or whey of Goats; in Melancholly with conſerve of Burrage or Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſs, in Flegmatick with Conſerve of Betony, in thoſe that have knobs with Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, and two ſcruples for a doſe. But doubtleſs it was not oyl which <hi>Saxonia</hi> gave, but a liquid extract or Tincture as they cal it. For no oyl is diſtilled from this wood by an Alembick: but that which is diſtilled by a retort, or deſcent by an open fire, is found to be ſuch, that it cannot conveniently be given into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nay ſcarce with ſafety.</p>

               <p>There are ſome alſo who think, the leaves and fruit of this tree being reduced into Conſerves and Electuaries are to be uſed, and they relate, that the Indians infected with this diſeaſe, do uſe them as Medicines; but though the leaves and fruit may do ſomwhat in a light diſeaſe, yet they are not ſufficient in that which is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37365:23"/>great and inveterate, neither are they able to perform what the wood doth.

               <p>NExt to Guajacum,
<note place="margin">Sarſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla.</note> that Root challengeth the firſt place in curing the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſe, which ſome call Spartam Parillam, ſome Salſam Parillam; the Spaniards Sarſam Parillam, by reaſon of the ſimilitude which it hath with the plant called rough bindweed. By reaſon of its thornes 'tis cailed Sarſa (for Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa in Spaniſh ſignifies Bryers or Brambles) but by reaſon of its leaves, and boughs, Parilla, that is to ſay the thorny vine. Nay <hi>Fallopius de Morb. Galli. Cap.</hi> 63. is of that opinion, that it is truly the rough bindweed, which grows every where in <hi>Italy,</hi> and he writes that by the uſe of it, he hath with happy ſucceſs freed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from the French Pox. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> alſo <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 139. writes thus of the rough bindweed, its leaves and fruit being drank before, and after, are antidotes againſt deadly poyſons; and beſides 'tis delivered that if ſomwhat of them pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered be given to a new born infant to drink, no poyſon ſhal afterwards hurt it. But grant it be ſo, that the Italian rough bindweed can do ſomwhat againſt this diſeaſe, as alſo againſt other poyſons, yet he himſelf grants, that there is no light difference betwixt this and the Indian.</p>
               <p>But Sarſaparilla grows in <hi>Peru,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The native place of ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaparilla.</note> in the hedges, as rough bindweed, the white and black Bryony, and hops do in Europe. The Root creeps far up and down by the Earth, that 'tis oftentimes above ſix cubits long, which gathered into bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles is brought over to us. The good and freſh is white, ſolid, but that which is reddiſh, and poudery when 'tis broke, is leſs effectual.</p>
               <p>Its vertue as I have ſaid is very great alſo in curing this diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">The vertue of it.</note> and 'tis found by experience, that many have been cured by the uſe of it, without Guajacum, and becauſe 'tis more Temperate; and moderatly hot, and without any acrimony, bitterneſs, or aſtriction, or ſmel, but hath a certain obſcure ſweetneſs, it may ſafely be given to al conſtitutions of body, and al Ages; beſides 'tis of thin parts, provokes ſweat, dries eminently, reſiſts putrefaction, waſts ſuperfluous humidity, ſomwaht looſneth the body, and therefore is wont in ſome ſort to weaken the ſtomach; but though Guajacum be more powerful and efficacious, yet Sarſa in this exceeds that wood, that it hath an eminent power to allay the French pains, though never ſo accute and ſtubborn, by reaſon of its exceeding tenuity, penetrating and laxative vertue: and <hi>Jul. Palmarius</hi> writes, that no pain can happen ſo contumacious and ſo continual, which at length it doth not lay aſleep and overcome, if any one uſe the decoction of it for a long time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly. Nay al knotty French Tumors ſo they be not bony, in what part ſoever they are, are Rooted out by the uſe of it, their matter being melted and caſt forth by ſweats, or at the leaſt waſted and emptyed by inſenſible perſpiration: and <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopius</hi> writes in the alleaged place, that if after the diſeaſe is overcome there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Ulcers, Clefts about the ARſehole, that Sarſaparilla will heal them ſooner by half than the Indian wood, and in a ſhort time alſo the moſt hard knobs are diſcuſſed by it. Yet ſome admoniſh here, that by Guajacum indeed this diſeaſe may be perfectly cured, and that al things are found in Guajacum; which are neceſſary for the cure of this diſeaſe, but that ſarſa doth not alone, but mixt with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37365:23"/>Guajacum, China Root, and Saſſafras wood cure this diſeaſe, and for this reaſon, becauſe it looſneſs the ſtomach, heats leſs, is void of al acrimony, and therefore is not ſo abſterſive, and being inodorous, hath not the power to refreſh the ſpirits. But theſe accuſations fetcht from the manifeſt qualities, ſeem not to be ſufficient; truly that Guajacum doth challenge the firſt place in this diſeaſe, is not to be denied, in the interim it hath been obſerved alſo by many, that ſomtimes this diſeaſe hath been cured by the uſe of this Root only; and if perhaps it do to much lax the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that may eaſily be prevented.</p>
               <p>But this alſo is given divers waies,
<note place="margin">The manner of giving it.</note> for the moſt part as Guajacum in the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning which we muſt note, they that wil not ſpare for coſt and deſire the decoction ſhould be more effectual, they ought to take only the bark, as which is the more effectual part of the Root, and to caſt away the inner piths as that which is leſs effectual, nay as 'tis delivered by ſome 'tis more cold, and hath a certain aſtrictive faculty.</p>
               <p>But the Root of Sarſaparilla is taken being ſliced thin and to one ounce of it is poured two pound of water,
<note place="margin">The decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> or to two ounces and an half of the Root four pound of Water; ſome pour to four ounces of the Root feven pound of Water, others to three ounces; ten pound of water. Neither can the quantity of the water to the Root be ſo ſtrictly preſcribed, but it may be varied according to the Nature of the diſeaſe, and the condition of the ſick, and the ſeaſon of the year. For in an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate diſeaſe there is need of a ſtronger decoction, in a new, of a weaker. But it is ſteeped firſt of al fifteen hours or twenty, and afterwards boyled to the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one half; and reaſons, liquoriſh and other things are added to the decoction, as need requires as in the decoction of Guajacum; and becauſe the decoction of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa doth ſomwhat lax the ſtomach, for the moſt part mint, Betony, or ſomwhat elſe that ſtrengthens the ſtomach is to be added, or what ſeems more commodious, Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacum, or leaſt the mixture of divers things may breed nauſeouſneſs after the taking of the decoction of Sarſaparilla, they muſt take ſomwhat that ſtrengthens the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>After the firſt decoction is prepared,
<note place="margin">The ſecond decoction.</note> fifteen pound of water are poured again to the remainders, and are boyled til a third is waſted, and the decoction is uſed at dinner and Supper; ſome alſo add towards the end of the decoction three pound of Wine; yet this muſt be done then only as <hi>Fallopius</hi> thinks, either when the ſick body goes abroad, to preſerve his ſtrength, or when the ſtomach is weak.</p>
               <p>Yet there may alſo be prepared out of this Root, pouders, Electuaries, extracts, as are from Guajacum.</p>

               <p>THe Portugal Merchants brought over in the former Age,
<note place="margin">China root.</note> from the Country of China, a certain Root for the cure of this diſeaſe, which they called China Root; for when as the Venereal diſeaſe had invaded that Country alſo, as the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans ſhewed the uſe of Guajacum for the deſtroying of this diſeaſe, ſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of China uſed this Root to cure the ſame diſeaſe, and taught others the uſe of it. But the Root is a handbreadth long, ſomtimes pretty thick, ſomtimes thinner, knobbed, ſomwhat reddiſh, pretty weighty, which being newly digged up they report is ſo tender, that it may be eaten raw, and boyled, as turnep and rape Roots are with us; the which ſeems not to be very credible, whenas our Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neps, Rape Roors dryed never attain to ſo great a hardneſs: they are brought to us divided.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:37365:24"/>
               <p>As concerning its vertues, 'tis neither ſtrong in ſmel, nor taſt, and therefore there is no exceſs of it in heat and cold, but 'tis rather temperate, or if there be any exceſs in it, 'tis rather in cold; yet 'tis dry in the ſecond, of thin ſubſtance, yet with a certain aſtrictive power, and a kind of ſubſtantifical moiſture, ſo that by the uſe of it men do grow Fat. Whence alſo the decoction of it doth eaſily ſowr. When it was firſt brought over by the Portugals into France and the neighbouring provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it was wonderfully cryed up by the Merchants, as being of thin parts, and having power to digeſt, to more urine and ſweat, to conſum Excrements of al ſorts, to clenſe the Bowels, free from obſtructions, clear the blood from corruption, to cake away pains in the Joynts, to be good for the Venereal diſeaſe, and becauſe 'tis temperate, it may ſafely be given to any age, ſex; any time of the year, and to thoſe that are feaveriſh; al which faculties whenas they are not in Guajacum, by ſome of that time it was made uſe of not only for the cure of other diſeaſes, but alſo for the cure of the pox it was preferred before Guajacum. Which very thing cauſed that <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour, being ſick of a moſt grievous Gout, was the firſt almoſt that would make tryal of the uſe of this Root, upon the advice of ſome Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians. But experience afterwards leſſened that ſame; and <hi>Jul. Palmarius</hi> writes of this buſineſs <hi>de lue Vener. Cap.</hi> 14. that many to their great detriment have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred this root before Guajacum, and that he hath found by experience, that alſo in a very ſtrict diet it hath been uneffectual againſt this diſeaſe, oftentimes alſo the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is ſeen to become ſo moiſt with the uſe of its decoction, and the Native heat oppreſt, that a great Lientery, and crudity hath often followed in thoſe who had but weak Fuell for their implanted heat. Beſides theſe diſcommodities and faults, he writes alſo that it doth oftentimes cauſe ſwelling of the Spleen and hardneſs, in thoſe that uſe it long; neither doth he grant it to have extraordinary vertue againſt this diſeaſe either by its whol ſubſtance or occult quality, when as after the uſe of it, they who thought themſelves wel, do dayly fal into a relapſe of the ſame Diſeaſe. The ſame alſo is confirmed by <hi>Gabriel Fallopius Lib. de Morb. Galli. Cap.</hi> 60. who writes that he hath uſed this Root again and again, for the Cure of this Diſeaſe, but could do nothing with it, in the interim he writes that he hath uſed it with happy ſucceſs for the dropſie, to moderate the mobility of the Humors in hot bleared Eyes, and in a hot diſtemper of the ſtomach and Liver. And other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians alſo agree in this, that this Root for the Cure of the French Pox is far in feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to Guajacum and Sarſaparilla, although it be profitable to preſerve and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the heat of our body, and therefore for other diſeaſes. And if by chance any one, who could not be cured neither by the decoction of Guajacum nor by the unction of Quick-ſilver, hath recovered health by the Decoction of China <hi>Jul. Palmarius</hi> thinks this is the Cauſe of it, becauſe Nature rejoycing in the Variety of Remedies and weary of the ſtronger, at length is eaſied by thoſe that are leſs effectual. Yet <hi>Garzias ab Horto,</hi> relates of the Root being freſh, that it doth ſo exceedingly heat, that if any one uſe the pure Decoction of it, or drink it hot, by reaſon of the too great heat of the Medicine he wil fal into exceeding heats of the liver, Eryſipilaes, and Phlegmons, and other moſt grievous Symptoms. But when as 'tis brought over to us inſipid and ſomtimes duſty, there is no cauſe to fear any ſuch thing. Neither doth this only happen in this plant, but alſo in many others, that the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental juyce hath far other vertues, then the dryed Plants: and therefore though perhaps this Root being freſh in China may have great vertue to Cure the Venereal Diſeaſe, yet it is not neceſſary, that it retain the ſame with us.</p>
               <p>But divers prepare the decoction of this root diverſly,
<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of China.</note> 
                  <hi>Jul. Palmarius</hi> writes that the common way of preparing it is this, that to two ounces of the root, cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rounds, and put in an earthen pot, there is poured four pound of water and let them ſteep twelve houres, afterwards boyl with a gentle fire to the conſumption of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37365:24"/>the one half. <hi>Fallopius</hi> boyles two ounces of the root in twelve pound of water, to the conſumption of half, but according to the nature of the diſeaſe the proportion of the root and water may be varied: and the root may be boylled from one to three in twelve pound of water. Yet <hi>Septalius</hi> adviſeth us here, that this decoction is moſt commodiouſly prepared, if one ounce of the root freſh and not rotten be boyled in ten pound of water, &amp; two ounces in twelve pound of water. For he writes, though many phyſitians, to ſave charges, whenas many cannot take al that decoction in one day, and they feare if they ſhould keep it another day it would grow ſowre, do boyl half the portion of China in half the quantity of water, and boyl away the half, or two thirds, thinking that ſo they have both ſaved their purſe, and prepared the decoction as ſtrong, yet they are very much deceived, and if they have not loſt their taſte, they ſhal eaſily know, that that firſt decoction is much more powerful, than the ſecond, and the reaſon is ready, becauſe 'tis not enough to give a proportion of the root to the water, but the time of boyling is cheifly to be conſidered, and the action of the heat of the fire, and the reaction of the water. For whenas, foure houres ſpace, imagine, ought to be allowed, to extract the vertue out of a moſt hard root, and communicate it to the water: how much time wil be ſpent in boyling away ſix or eight pints of water, if taking but the half quantity, viz. half an ounce of China with ſix pints of water, we ſuffer the half to waſt or two thirds, which wil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in leſs than two houres ſpace, the water being leſs able to reſiſt the action of the fire? nor let any one dare to ſay that we may prevent this inconveniency, by making a leſs quantity of fire, and if it he boyled by a ſlower fire for to extract this vertue out of a more ſolid ſubſtance, there ought alſo to concur a due quantity of fire.</p>
               <p>Out of the remainders another drink is prepared by ſome for dinner and ſupper,
<note place="margin">The Second decoction.</note> as out of Guajacum. Yet <hi>Palmarius</hi> thinks that al the vertue of that root is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in the liquor at the firſt boyling, and therefore for ordinary drink he boyles three ounces more of the root in eight pound of water til two pints are conſumed and he ads raiſons and liquariſh, nay ſome alſo drink the firſt decoction, at dinner and ſupper, whenas it is not unpleaſant to the taſt.</p>
               <p>Some alſo do admoniſh us, that we provide no more of the decoction at once than may be ſpent in one day, whenas it quickly growes ſour when 'tis cold, therefore they command alſo that it be kept on warm aſhes: but experience hath taught us that it wil laſt four dayes. Yet becauſe it growes ſour, that very thing tels us that this root hath in it, ſomewhat ſpirituous and alimental, which is the cauſe of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and hence of acidity.</p>

               <p>BUt though al the medicines hitherto reckoned up,
<note place="margin">Compouond Alexiphbr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maca in the Veneral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> are good to deſtroy this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, yet ſome are more effectual then others, and beſides ſome have other qualities, for the which they are uſeful ſometimes for this, ſometimes for that end, as was ſaid of the ſimples: and therefore ſeldom one of theſe medicines is uſed, but for the moſt part, many of them together. Indeed if the diſeaſe be ſimple, and none of the bowels be affected, nor there is no eminent diſtemper in any part, which may hinder the uſe of Guajacum, that wood is the moſt excellent of al, becauſe it reſiſts this diſeaſe both by its occult and manifeſt qualities: but if any diſeaſe be joyned with it, tis oftentimes moſt profitable to add ſarſaparilla and China and there are added by ſome manny altering medicines, of which whenas we ſpake before, in this place we ſhal ad nothing of them, but this, that we muſt have a care leaſt by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Succories and endives and cooling medicines which are added to moderate the heat of Guajacum which yet is not ſo much to be feared, they hinder ſweating which is only to be deſired, and which brings more benefit, then a little heating can do dammage: next of al leaſt by the admixtion of other things the drink be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and nauſeous, therefore paſſing by theſe that we may ſpeake ſomewhat of the mixture of alexipharmaca, if the nature of the patient be very hot and dry, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37365:25"/>the humors violently fal from the head on the lungs, breaſt or other parts, Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum wood is not commodiouſly given alone, whenas it doth farther heat and dry the parts, and by its heat make the humors run and move, but then ſarſaparilla is ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and China more comodious, which doth at once moderate the heat, and hath an aſtrictive power, by which it ſtops defluxions: on the contrary if the ſtrength be feeble, and there be a weaknes of the ſight, ſarſa is not commodious, whenas it looſenſs the ſtomach, and duls the fight, if there be a great conſumption (if ſo be it hath not its original from the Venereal diſeaſe, for then this diſeaſe being taken away as the cauſe, that waſting alſo ceaſeth, and the body begins to be nouriſht better) Guajacum and ſarſaparilla are not ſafe, But then china is far more profitable, as that which moiſtens ſubſtantifically, as they ſpeak.

<note place="margin">Whether purgers ought to be mixt with the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> whiles the decoction is drank to wit whether they ought to be mixt with the decoction or to be uſed at the ſame time with the decoction. For ſome do wholy reject them, and hold that purgers are neither to be mixed with the decoction, nor to be uſed apart, for this reaſon, becauſe the bodies are wont diligently to be purged before they come to the uſe of theſe decoctions; next of al becauſe purgers and ſweaters do cauſe contrary motions. Others on the contrary do mix purgers with theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions, that by benefit of them the blood may be purefied, and the belly conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept looſe: others do not mix purgers with theſe decoctions, but purge at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain intervals, every eighth or tenth day, or at a longer diſtance, as need requires. which laſt opinion ſeemes to me to be treweſt. For though the body be purged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the uſe of theſe decoctions, yet ſome may eaſily remain, and ever and anon be collected, and ſweating doth purge onely the thinner humors, but leaves the thick, neither after this manner are there cauſed contrary motions; for that day, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging is ordered ſweaters are not adminiſtred; but if purgers were mixed with the ſweaters then there would be contrary motions. And beſides by the admiſtion of purgers, the decoction being to be uſed ſo many weeks it would become nauſeous and ingratful.</p>

<note place="margin">Whether purgers may ſerve inſtead of ſweaters.</note> That purging may be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered every day, to wit in thoſe, in whom ſweat cannot, or ought not to be cauſed: he thinks ſweat cannot be provoked in them, who either are of ſuch a hard and thick Skin, that they can by no means ſweat, or in thoſe who fal into fainting and ſwou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fits, as ſoon as ſweaters are adminiſtred: but he thinks they ought not to ſweat, in whom the Veneral diſeaſe poſſeſſeth not the Joynts, nor the Skin, nor the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the body, but hath rather taken up its ſeat about the bowels; but this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeems not to me to be agreeable to truth: for whereas he thinks, that ſome ought to have purgers adminiſtred becauſe they cannot ſweat by reaſon of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Skin, or becauſe they preſently fal into ſwouning fits, is agreeable neither to reaſon, nor experience: for ſcarce any one hath ſo thick a Skin, that the pores wil no way open for ſweat, and though on the firſt daies ſweat doth not prelently follow, yet after that the Humors are attenuated by the uſe of the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the paſſages and pores are opened, then ſweat ſucceeds; eſpecially if thoſe Laconick Baths be applied as ſhal be ſaid hereafter. And the Patient may ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate his ſweating, that he need not fal into fainting or ſwouning fits: and they that cannot endure ſweating, wil not eaſily endure purging. Laſt of al purgers cannot performe the ſame, as thoſe ſweaters do. But that in ſome bodies ſweaters are not to be adminiſtred, is ſalf: for though the diſeaſe may have its principal ſeat about the Liver and bowels, yet it cannot be, but alſo vitious Humors do abound in the whol body, whenas the Liver infected with this diſeaſe doth generate virulent blood, and diſtribute it to the whol Body.</p>

               <p>AS concerning the manner of uſing theſe Medicaments,
<note place="margin">The manner of uſing theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. The doſe of the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> firſt of al the decoction of Guajacum is adminiſtred, for the moſt part in the morning, and afternoon two hours before Supper. In the morning 'tis given from five ounces to eight or nine ounces before the evening, from three ounces to ſix ounces; the pouder is given to two drams, the extract to two ſcruples. Yet ſomtimes the evening drauft is omitted, eſpecially at the begining, before the patient is accuſtomed to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. For what was ſaid above of moderating the quality of the decoction, that alſo is to be obſerved concerning the quantity of the Decoction to be given, that the ſick be not offended and overcharged which too much of it; which unleſs it be obſerved, it happens ſomtimes, that the ſick fal into Feavers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Crudities, and there is cauſed a looſneſs, ill habit of body, and a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
               <p>After the ſame manner we muſt give the Decoction of Sarſapatilla, China Root, and the compound decoctions. For though ſome do preſcribe here divers doſes, yet he ſhal not erre, that ſhal adminiſter them in the aforeſaid manner.</p>
               <p>And indeed after the mornings drauft,
<note place="margin">Sweat.</note> we muſt endeavor that the Patient ſweat; for expetience teacheth, that they that ſweat not upon the taking of theſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>carce clearly freed from this Diſeaſe: but that ſweat may flow the eaſier, let the Patient ſleep one hour after he hath taken the Medicine, for ſo the Medicine is deduced into act.
<note place="margin">The time of ſweating.</note> As for the time of ſweating, firſt of al it is ſufficient, if the patient ſweat one hour, afterwards by degrees let him riſe to more. But the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſweating is various; moſt do ſuffer their Patients to ſweat in bed, which that they may do the eaſier bottles ful of warm water, or hot brick wrapt up in Cloaths, muſt be placed under the Arm-pits and ſides of the Patient. Some provide a woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Mantle ſuch a one as <hi>Andreas Tenzelius,</hi> hath diſcribed and ſet forth in <hi>Exegeſ. Chymiatre:</hi> which manner of ſweating is not a little toubleſome. But not without cauſe moſt men do prefer before al kinds of ſweating in this diſeaſe, that which is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37365:26"/>in a bath or ſweating place as that which brings leſs trouble to the ſick, when as weak Patients ſweating in their bed, may uſe a Bath and a ſweating place, and the heat of the bath may be made more intenſe or remiſs at pleaſure, be made dry or moiſt as the condition of the ſick requires: yet a moiſt hath, and gently heated by the Vapor of hot water is moſt commodious; whenas that hot vapor of the Water, doth open and Lax the pores of the Skin, that the ſweat flows the eaſier, and without any trouble to the ſick: but dry baths are altogether laborious, and ought not to be uſed in dry and Melancholy bodies.</p>
               <p>But thoſe ſweating baths are twofold,
<note place="margin">Baths two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> firſt of al thoſe gaeat ones in which a body may walk, ſuch as are our baths ſo commonly called in which many at once may ſweat and be waſhed; ſuch though they be uſed for the cure of this diſeaſe by Barbers in Italy, yet they ought to be eſchewed, whenas if one that is lightly infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, receive that which exhales from another grievouſly infected, he may be infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more, and 'tis more commodious that every ſick body ſweat by himſelf. Then there are baths or ſmal ſweating places in which one alone cloſed up may ſweat: ſuch are made of bords of wood Joyned together, which again are twofold, ſome which can receive a man upright. Without bowing of his body, <hi>Jul. Palmarius</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes it <hi>de lue Vener. Cap.</hi> 17. of a Square figure, ſeven Foot high, and four foot long and broad, whoſe deſcription you may ſee there. With us others are in uſe made up of boards mutually receiving and received by one another, ſquare, but oblong. of that bredth, that a man may without any impediment ſet and extend his Arms, but two ſtories high, one where the Patient ſets, ſo high, that as he ſets he may put forth his Head, through a hole of the bords ſtrictly fitted for the neck, but the lower part is of that depth, that if the Patient ſetting ſtretch forth his Feet, he cannot reach the loweſt board: and it hath a little door, through which the ſick may go into it, and a window behind, which may be opened upon neceffity: and it hath another little door towards the feet, through which an Iron or braſs Veſſel is put in ful of ſtones or refuſe Iron red hot; and a Pipe in the upper part of it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Veſſel, through which either plain hot water, or ſome convenient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction is poured on the ſtones or droſs by degrees, as much as the Patient can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, from whence the Vapor exhaling diffuſed al through the body doth provoke ſweat: and though after this manner the head be thruſt forth, yet that doth no hurt, neither is it unprofitable, even where the head is affected; for though it ſtands forth, yet that ſweats plentifully enough: in the interim the Patient doth not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract again by drawing in his breath thoſe filthy Vapors which do Evaporate from his body, but the free and pure ayre by which he is refreſht, that he doth more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and happily endure ſweating. But in what bath ſoever ſweat is provoked, after the ſweating is over the bath ought to be opened, that thoſe filthy Vapors may be blown away and diſcuſſed by the free Air.</p>
               <p>The moſt convenient time for ſweating is the morning,
<note place="margin">When we muſt ſweat.</note> yet ſomtimes we may ſweat after noone, in which caſe the ſtrength of the Patient is to be conſidered for there are ſome who wil eaſily endure ſweating twice a day, other who but once, others who are not able to endure ſweating once every day. But the Medicines which moue ſweat muſt be taken upon an empty ſtomach, and an hour or two after the taking of the Medicine ſweat muſt be urged.</p>
               <p>But we muſt ſweat ſo long as the ſtrength of the Patient wil bear it,
<note place="margin">How long.</note> and if the patient ſweat in a bath, or ſweating place, and is not able to endure any longer the heat of the bath, he muſt be laid in his bed, in which afterwards ſweat wil flow of its own accord, and without any loſs of ſtrength; the ſweat muſt afterwards be wiped of, and after ſweating the cold ayre muſt in no wiſe be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>But how often we muſt ſweat,
<note place="margin">How often.</note> and how long the uſe of theſe Medicines is to be continued, cannot be defined in general. They commonly teach that theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions are to be continued for forty daies, yet ſomtimes twenty five daies or thirty do ſuffice: and ſomtimes in a more grievous Diſeaſe we muſt perſiſt in the uſe of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37365:27"/>theſe Medicines til ſixty daies and more. For we muſt ſweat ſo often and ſo long, til the Malignity of the Diſeaſe is overcome, and the vitious and vitulent Humors are diſcuſſed by ſweating, and al the Symptomes ceaſe, eſpecially the running of the Reins and Callous skars. For as long as theſe laſt. We muſt remain in the uſe of theſe Medicines. Nay though al the Symptomes do vaniſh, yet it is good ſo to continue the Medicines for ſome daies, that alſo the Maligne diſpoſitions of the parts may be taken away, that there be no fear of a relapſe.</p>
               <p>But after noon, though ſweat be not moved, yet the ſame decoction given then, may inſenſibly diſcuſſe the vitious Humors, and deſtroy the virulent diſpoſition impreſt both on the parts and Humors.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>Of the Cure by Quick-ſilver.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ANd this is the chief kind of Medicine for the cure of the Venereal diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">Of the cure by Quick-ſilver.</note> and this is the chief manner of curing it. For there is alſo another way of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame Diſeaſe by quick-ſilver, which was firſt brought into uſe by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions and barbers, afterwards alſo was applyed by learned Phyſitians. For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, as was ſaid before by <hi>Fracaſtorius,</hi> certain Barbars had found out amongſt the Medicines of our anceſtors for the filthy ſcab joyned with the pains of the joynts, unguents compounded of Mercury and Sulphur, other Medicines profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting little, they began to uſe them. The uſe of which being not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, afterwards quick-ſilver was uſed in the cure of this Diſeaſe by many learned Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>But though it be not my purpoſe in this place to treat of quick-ſilver, which the Chymiſts cal Mercury, but rather of the uſe of it in curing this diſeaſe, yet I ſhal admoniſh you of a few things in general. Quick-ſilver is reckoned amongſt the mettals, and 'tis called Silver from its color in which it reſembles ſilver,
<note place="margin">Quickſilver whence ſo called. Its wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nature.</note> but quick becauſe tis alwaies moveable: and its Nature is altogether wonderful, which many learned men admire, and which hath tortered the wits of many Chymiſts, and deluded their pains. For though it be mortified, fixed, or what way ſoever it oftentimes ſeems to be changed, yet it is eaſily reduced to its former quick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And though it be reduced into the ſmalleſt bodies, and tranſmitted through leather, or be otherwiſe reduced into atomes, and a ſtrong form, yet it retaines in them its whol Nature and eſſence, and returns to its former quick body.</p>
               <p>Naturaliſts and Phyſitians differ concerning its temperament,
<note place="margin">Whether Quickſilver be hot or cold.</note> whiles ſome hold it to be cold others hot. <hi>Matthias <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nzerus,</hi> hath collected the arguments of both in <hi>Anatom. Spagyr. Mercu.</hi> to alleage al which at large in this place, is not our intent, for you may conſult with him on that buſineſs in the alleaged place; yet by and by we ſhal make mention of ſome of them: but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nzerus</hi> himſelf, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. goes the middle way, and holds,
<note place="margin">Matthias <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nzerus his opinion.</note> that ſome natural things have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in them diverſe, and wholly contrary vertues and faculties, and ſome of them are manifeſt, others occult, and that theſe depend on the ſpecifick form, thoſe on the firſt qualities of the Elements, which he proves by the examples of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Rhubarb, Vineger, and others: and he thinks Mercury is to be reckoned in the number of theſe which may be conſidered both as crude, and as prepared: the crude he thinks hath mixt qualities, and is partly hot, partly cold, and that diverſity is to be attributed to the divers parts of the matter of which it conſiſts, ſome of which are very thin, Subtile, pure, and Spirituous, but ſome are thick, earthy and feculent: but he thinks that Mercury prepared hath no longer any
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37365:29"/>cold quality, but they are wholly taken away by the outward help of fire, or by the Application of the menſtrua, and therefore that it is very hot</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hercules Saxonia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hercules Saxonia.</note> holds the ſame <hi>de lue Vener. Cap.</hi> 39. Whiles he teacheth, that this Medicine doth exulcerate, and cauſe heat and inflamation; on the other ſide it cauſeth numneſs, Palſies, and other cold affects, and that it proceeds from the inequality of its temperament, and becauſe 'tis an imperfect mixt body, and if it be prepared by calcination, that the cold ſubſtance doth fly away, and that which is left, is fire,</p>
               <p>But theſe authors erre very much,
<note place="margin">The authors opinion.</note> indeed it cannot be denied, that there are many Medicines, which have Heterogeneous parts, by vertue of which, they produce divers effects, which parts alſo may be ſeparated by the help of art: But that Quick-ſilver hath ſuch parts, is falſ, neither was there yet ever found any Chymiſt, who could ſhow the diverſe parts in it, and ſeparate them by art: for the whol is Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if there be any thing ſo in Nature, and either it al flies away, or al remaines, and what way ſoever it is prepared,
<note place="margin">Quickſilver is Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</note> at laſt it al revives wholly Homogeneous: and whatſoever Chymiſt can ſhow any Heterogeneous parts in Quick-ſilver, as in Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batb, ſhal be in my eſteem a great Apollo. Neither is precipitate of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then that which is crude, neither doth Quick-ſilver looſe any thing by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and that prepared does differ from the crude only in external form which is caured by the admiſtion of other things, which ſomtimes are Salt parts as happens in Mercury Sublimate and Precipitate, ſomtimes only watry as when Mercury is reduced into water by a retort without the admiſtion of any other thing, as the ſame <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nzerits</hi> teacheth <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Anatom. Mercu. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 4. for this water is nothing elſe but the Quick-ſilver reſolved into the ſmalleſt bodies or Atomes by the ſtrength of the fire, and mixt with watry Vapors, or the moiſt Air. Yet in that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare no effects of cold, but rather of heat, and that very water, as other mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al waters, wil diſſolve gold in like manner, <hi>Saxonia</hi> is miſtaken, for Quick-filver is no imperfect mixt body, but a body that hath the moſt perfect miſtion, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deſtroied, by any art of the Chymiſts, but every where retaines its form, neither whiles it is calcined (or rather expoſed to the ſire, for Quick-ſilver cannot properly be ſaid to be Calcmed) do the cold parts fly away, and the fiery ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, but if thoſe parts which are raiſed up be received, they are of the ſame Nature with thoſe that remaine, as is wel known to the Chymiſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore whenas this Reconcilation is of no force,
<note place="margin">Quick ſilver is hot.</note> let us ſee who is in the righter whether thoſe who hold Quick-ſilver to be hot, or thoſe that ſay 'tis cold. But I think that they are altogether of the righter judgment, who think it to be hot; for that appears by its great penetrating and corroding vertue, ſo that it penetrates and Eats into Mettals, and the fleſh, nay the very bones are corroded by Mercury preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate and ſublituate. And <hi>Libavius</hi> writes in <hi>tract, de igne natu. cap.</hi> 30, that he knew by the relation of a moſt learned Phyſitian, that a certain Chyrurgion dying by the too frequent uſe of Mercurial Medicines, had his bones plainly britle or frangible.</p>
               <p>But whenas they object firſt of al,
<note place="margin"> The anſwer of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt it.</note> that whiles 'tis quick and whol it doth not corrode: the cauſe of that is, becauſe it cannot infinuate it ſelf into the body, and worke upon it, whenas al its parts are moſt cloſely knit together, nor cannot be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other bodies; but the Medicines prepared out of it as Mercury ſublimate, Precipitate, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Oyl of Mereury, and it there be any more of this kind, have a great power to burn and corrode not only by the reaſon of Salts commixt, which is very little, but becauſe 'tis reſolved into the ſmaleſt bodies, and being mixt with the Salts it can adhere to the body, and by the benefit of things admixt, moſt intimately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate it ſelf into it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whereas Quick-ſilver appears cold to the touch, that is common to it with ſteel, Braſs, Lead, Wine, things of their own Nature hot, which by accident feel to be cold.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:37365:29"/>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whereas ſome alſo from the effects would collect quick-ſilver to be cold, in that they are very much deceived; and they attribute thoſe effects to cold, which have their dependance elſwhere. Truly, they that drink the waters infected with quick-ſilver on the Alps, are ſick of divers fluxes, and are taken with a bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chocele. Goldſmiths, and others, who often deal with quick-ſilver, are ſeldom healthful and long lived, but are obnoxious to numneſſes, tremblings, palſies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, lethargies, ſuffocating, catarths, and appoplexies. Thus <hi>Fernelius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of a certain Goldſmith that imprudently admitting the vapour of quick-ſilver only, preſently became ſtupid, drowzy, and wholly ſpeechleſs. <hi>Ferdinandus Ponrertus</hi> relates that the ſame happend to another, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de vene. cap.</hi> 3. And <hi>Foreſtus, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>obſer.</hi> 5. writes, That a certain yong man learning the Smiths art upon the atching of a Cup with quick-ſilver, had all the hair of his head fell off, and that his face became extraordinary pale, and all his body tremulous; and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have obſerved the ſame. And <hi>Jacobus Oethoeus, in his obſervat.</hi> reports, That a certain yong Noble man troubled with Crab-lice in his Privities, uſed Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Oyntment to drive them away; upon which his Yard grew cold and ſluggiſh, and unfit for Venery. But here is a fallacy of the cauſe, for quick-ſilver doth not do theſe things by cooling, but becauſe it hath a peculiar and occult quality, that is an enemy to the Nerves and Brain, as appears in many other ſtupifying poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That which is Objected, is eaſily Anſwered; to wit, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That the damage brought upon mans body by quick ſilver, is cured by the uſe of hot things; as Sage, Hyſſope, Origanum, Clary, Rue, Caſtor, and the like: For thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not therefore applied to the preternatural affects cauſed by quick-ſilver only, becauſe they are hot, but becauſe they are friends to the Brain and Nerves: and furthermore, as they themſelves grant, by a ſpecifick property are enemies to the Mercurial virulency; and that ſuch things are not therefore applied becauſe they are hot, but becauſe by a peculiar vertue they are friends to the Nerves, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this, becauſe other hot things, as Ginger, Pepper, and the like, which have no ſpecifick property freindly to the Nerves, do not perform the ſame.</p>
               <p>But concerning the Occult Vertue and Propriety of Quick-ſilver, we chiefly meet with two doubts; Firſt of all, Whether it be poyſonous: next of all, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be rightly applied for the Cure of the Venereal Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Concerning the former Queſtion, Whether Quick-ſilver be Poyſonous,
<note place="margin">Whether quick-fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous.</note> we have already treated before, in <hi>tractat. de Chym. &amp; Ariſtot. conſenſ. &amp; diſſenſ. cap.</hi> 19. where we ſpeak of Mercury, and we ſaid there, That <hi>Matthias <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nzerus de anatem. ſpagyr. Mercu.</hi> did endeavour to prove at large, That Mercury is not poyſonous, with whom others alſo agree; eſpecially thoſe who urge Experience and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of learned Phyſitians. <hi>Avicen, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Fen.</hi> 6. <hi>tract.</hi> 1. <hi>ſum.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. writes,
<note place="margin">'Tis denied.</note> That Quick-ſilver doth not hurt many that drink it; for that with its qualities goes forth by the ſtool. <hi>Haly Abbas lib</hi> 1. <hi>pract. cap.</hi> 35. <hi>Rhaſes</hi> in <hi>no. ad Manſor. de potu argen. vi.</hi> do affirm the ſame. <hi>Braſſavolus</hi> alſo doth teſtifie in <hi>lib. de ſtirp. exami.</hi> That he hath given Quick-ſilver to Infants to expel Worms. And <hi>Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius de Metallis cap.</hi> 37. holds, That Mercury may be taken into the body without the fear of any hurt; and he relates that Beaſts do ſwallow quick-ſilver without any harm: For when they abound with Worms, which your Leeches know by their breath, if they ſwallow four ſeveral times half a Filbert ſhell full of Quick-ſilver caſt into their mouths, they are cured, no worſe Diſeaſe ſucceeding it. And he witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he hath given to Children in extream danger, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> means have availed nothing, the quantity of two or three grains of Millet with evident ſucceſs. The ſame Author, <hi>de Morb. Gallic. cap.</hi> 76. writes, That he ſaw a Woman which drank a pound of Mercury to cauſe an Abortion, yet without any hurt. <hi>Matthiolus</hi> alſo reports in <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>dioſcorid. cap.</hi> 170. (which alſo <hi>Euſtachrus Rudius</hi> relates, That he hath often obſerved, when he practiſed Phyſick there) That in the Town <hi>Gorritienſis</hi> the Nurſes do give Quick-ſilver to little Children to drink in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37365:30"/>quantity of two grains of Millet for the Worms in the Belly, without any trouble at al. And the Midwives when great bellied Women lie long in labor, do preſently give to drink a ſcruple weight of Mercury without any inconvenience: and <hi>Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Agricola</hi> relates, that a certain Woman did oftentimes fraudulently give Quick-ſilver to her Husband that ſhe might kil him, and nevertheleſs he continued health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nay it hath been obſerved that ſome thirſty in the night, have in the dark taken up Veſſels ful of Quick-ſilver inſtead of drinking Cups, and with a wide Throat have taken of the Quick-ſilver in a great quantity, yet have caſt it forth again by the ſtool without any hurt. And <hi>Euſtachius Rudius, add Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Morb. occult. cap.</hi> 15 that he hath ſeen this, and that others have obſerved it, that ſome bodies have been diſſected, in which no ſmal quantity of Quick-ſilver hath been collected in the Cavities of the bones, from the unction in the French Pox, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding have lived many years after the unction. Which ſeems not poſſible to be done, if it were poyſon by Nature.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Galen,
<note place="margin">'Tis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</note> Aetius,</hi> the reconciler, <hi>Cardan, Fernelius, Ferdinandus Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettus, Jul. Palmarius,</hi> whom I alleaged in the quoted place <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>de. conſens. et diſſens. Chymic. cum. Ariſtotele.</hi> do differ from theſe. And experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it ſelf hath brought moſt eminent men into that opinion, by which it is evident, that quickſilver doth no leſs cauſe numneſſes, convulſions, tremblings, palſeys, epilepſies, apoplexies, ſyncopes, than other poyſons, nay ſomtimes death it ſelf. And ſome do report, that they are ſeldom long lived, who digg up the veins of quickſilver; and though they be very ſtrong bodied, and of the beſt temperament, that they can ſcarce hold out in that work to the fifth yeare, but by drawing in the venenate vapors they are taken with a trembling of al their parts.</p>
               <p>And the opinion of theſe we think altogether more conſonant to truth as being that which is confirmed by experience it ſelfe:
<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> but as concerning the experience of thoſe, who write that quickſilver hath often been drank and given without any hurt, that doth not excuſe quickſilver from its venenoſity. For to the compleating of an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is required a right application of the agent to the parient, and ſome ſtay, which whenas it was wanting in the alleaged examples, the quickſilver could do no hurt for quickſilver is given either alive or prepared, if it be taken alive tis 'leſs hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for whenas quickſilver is a body moſt exactly mixt, and the leaſt parts of it do moſt pertinaceouſly cohere to one another, from whence alſo 'tis continually move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whiles it is whol and alive it brings little or no dammage to our body, but preſently is caſt forth by the ſtool. For in like manner as a leaden, or other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick bullet, if it be ſwallowed whol is preſently caſt forth of the body, and brings no hurt, but if it be reſolved into the leaſt parts, and contract ruſt, may do very much miſcheif, as that hiſtory concerning lead doth ſufficiently teach us, which <hi>Fernelius</hi> recites <hi>de lue Vener. cap.</hi> 7. So alſo if quickſilver be taken whol, move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and coherent to it ſelfe, and by reaſon of its mobility be preſently again caſt forth of the body, it brings no dammage; but if it be reſolved into the ſmalleſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and eſpecially with the admiſtion of ſalts, and by their help be as it were fixt to the body, and penetrate into it, both inwardly and outwardly applyed, it cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt greivous evils, as ſublimate and precipate do ſufficiently teach us, neither is there any reaſon for any one to aſcribe that corroding faculty to the ſalts mixed; for there is no falt in the ſome which exhales when Silver is gilding over, and yet that very fume is highly burtful; neither can ſo little ſalt as is mixt with ſublimate or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, cauſe ſo great hurt, whenas ſalt though it be given in a great quantity, doth no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>But as concerning prepared mercury,
<note place="margin">Mercury prepared.</note> I know indeed, with how great prayſes ſome do extol mercurial medicines. Some cal precipitate the angelical pouder, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe prepared mercury of life. Some commend the flowers of mercury of which we ſpake in <hi>conſens. et. diſſens. Chym. p.</hi> 365. others mercurius dulcis, and ſo highly, they write if it be rightly prepared and given 'tis as gentle as manna, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marinds, caſſia, and therefore they uſe it in the ſlighteſt diſeaſes, which might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37365:30"/>be taken away by more benigne medicines. But theſe commendations are too much, neither is their raſhneſs commendable, who give quickſilver in any diſeaſe, whenas we have every where examples of them, who by the uſe of the medicaments, have not only been caſt into danger of their lives, but have plainly periſht by them. Whereupon <hi>Guiſh. Fabricius</hi> in <hi>Epiſt. ad D. Doringium lib.</hi> 3. <hi>obſervat. annexa.</hi> thinks that that called mercurius vitae may ſomtimes be called mercurius mortis, and mercury of liſe eternal. And how much mercurius dulcis, which is counted the gentleſt of al, may ſomtimes prejudice, was ſaid in the alledged place; but that quickſilver may ſomtimes be given without any dammage coms to paſs, either becauſe 'tis crude, or retaines the nature of that alive: and therefore as was ſaid even now, can work little on our body, of which ſort is mercurius dulcis, and the flowers of ſilver mercury, or becauſe it is in its kind fixt. For as whol mettals though they be taken into the body, they do not affect it unleſs they be reſolved, ſo ſo alſo whenas fixt mercury doth as it were put on the nature of fixt mertals, ſo it doth not hurt, as that which is ſtil volatil, and can eaſily inſinuate it ſelf into the body.</p>
               <p>Yet prepared Mercury ought not raſhly to be uſed and be given in every diſeaſe or body eſpecially at the begining,
<note place="margin">In what diſeaſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury is to be given.</note> but in thoſe only in whom there is great ſtore of vitious humors, which that may empty, and where the body is ſtrong, for as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> ſublimate and precipitate outwardly applied in ſordid ulcers, doth mundefie them, and toucheth not the ſound fleſh as long as there is any filth, but if it be layd on the ſound fleſh it eats that: ſo alſo if quick-ſilver taken into the body do find cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humors on which it may work, it doth not eaſily damnefie the more inward parts, but it workes upon the humors, and cauſeth that they be emptied; but if there be no ſuch humors there, it alſo aſſailes the ſound parts. But whenas Quick-ſilver given inwardly is not uſed onely for the Venereal diſeaſe, but to drive away many other diſeaſes, we wil ſpeak no more of that here; but let us now inquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerning it, whether it can, and how it may do good in the Venereal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
               <p>As concerning one of them therefore,
<note place="margin">Whether quick-ſilver be to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the cure of the venerealdiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. The nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive opinion</note> to wit whether quick-ſilver ought to be given in the French pox, and whether it may be ſafely, and by what vertue it acts, Phyſitians do very much differ. <hi>Epiphanius Ferdinandus</hi> indeed, <hi>Hiſto.</hi> 17. thinks that amongſt ninety Authors that have writ of the Venereal diſeaſe, that there are onely foure, who have diſallowed of the uſe of Quickſilver in this diſeaſe, viz.

Galli. Cap.</hi> 4. Cals the cure of this diſeaſe performed by quickſilver, ſophiſtical, and writes that al anointed with it in his age ſuffered a relapſe. <hi>Gaſpar Torelus</hi> biſhop of <hi>St. Juſta,</hi> in his declammation againſt unction with Quickſilver, cals it a pernicious medicine and thanks it is to be ſhunned as the plague. <hi>Joh. Baptiſta Montanus,</hi> tract. de morb. <hi>Gal.</hi> writes that quick-ſilver doth indeed repreſs the diſeaſe for a certain time but does induce an evil quality in the part, and in no wiſe remove it, wherefore in proceſs of time, al things become worſe then they were before. <hi>John Fernelius lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de abdit. morb. cauſ. cap.</hi> 14. writes that he beleves nothing leſs, then that a medicine made of Quick-ſilver can cure the Venereal diſeaſe, ſince that in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it only takes away the ſimproms, leaving the root behind. <hi>Victor Favintinus cap.</hi> 7. <hi>de morb.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37365:31"/>as <hi>I</hi> ſaid <hi>John Baptiſta Silvaticus</hi> joynes himſelf, and writes that he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that quick-ſilver can wholy cure this diſeaſe, and that tis an antidote diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically repugnant to the Venereal evil: he doth not deny indeed that this medicine may allay ſome evil and vehement accidents of the diſeaſe, but that tis diametrically adverſe to the eſſence of the french pox, which is an occult property, inimicous to the liver, and that it can overcome that, he doth not beleeve. But though at the firſt riſe of this diſeaſe, Carpus the Chyrurgion firſt made uſe of this medicine (whome perhaps that barbor followed, whom <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> makes Mention of) being moved by this reaſon, becauſe he had obſerved that the ancient Arabian Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians did make uſe of Quick-ſilver againſt the contumacious ſcab, and many other rebellious diſeaſes of the skin; yet experience hath no way confirmed this remedy as the beſt, and therefore it hath been rejected by many phyſitians: for if Quick-ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were one of the antidotes of this diſeaſe it would have alwaies and every where anſwered the expectation, and there had bin no need that more effectual remedies ſhould have been ſought for from the remoteſt Countries beyond the Seas, which have hitherto be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n uſed with moſt happy ſucceſs, that no man doth any farther doubt of their efficacy in this Diſeaſe; and though Quick-ſilver doth heal French Ulcers, yet it doth not follow, that 'tis an Antidote againſt the Virulency of it as neither thoſe Medicines, which heal Buboes, or Carbuncles in the plague, can for that reaſon be accounted for Antidotes. <hi>Aurelius Minadous</hi> agrees with theſe, <hi>Lib. de Virul. Vener. cap.</hi> 39. Who wholy rejects the uſe of Quick-ſilver in this Diſeaſe, moved thereunto by three reaſons; the firſt is, becauſe he never ſaw any reſtored to health by the uſe of it; on the Contrary he hath rather obſerved many that by the uſe of Quick-ſilver have ſufferred worſe Symptomes in ſo much that they have affirmed, they have received greater dammage from the ſuppoſed Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then from the Diſeaſe: the ſecond is, that Quick-ſilver is hurtful by Reaſon of its exceſſive coldneſs: the third is becauſe no body can explain, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Quick-ſilver doth good in this Diſeaſe. To which ſome add a fourth Reaſon, that of it ſelf it is poyſon; and a fifth that many have died by the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>On the contrary many other Phyſitians do very much commend the uſe of Quick-ſilver in this Diſeaſe:
<note place="margin">The affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> and that I may now paſs by others, <hi>Epiphanius Ferdinandus, Hiſtor.</hi> 17. writes that he can make good by Oath, that he hath perfectly cured, leaving no evil Symptomes, a hundred and fifty people Frenchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of al Ages; Sexes, and of diverſe Temperaments, and at divers ſeaſons of the year; and he names another moſt experienced Phyſitian, <hi>Johan. Laurentius Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topapa,</hi> who hath affirmed to him by Oath' that he hath cured above a thouſand men Frenchified with the Mercurial Unguent with moſt happy ſucceſs, and he writes that we ought to give God thanks, that he would make known ſo wonderful a remedy for ſo great a diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>That we may quit our ſelves of this difficult controverſie,
<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> Firſt of al we think the uſe of Quick-ſilver is not wholly to be rejected in the Cure of this Diſeaſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the reaſons alleaged before by <hi>Minadous,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>others evince it: for firſt of al as concerning experience, here one experience may be oppoſed againſt another, and there are many Phyſitians who taught by experience it ſelf do with wonderful prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes extol Quick-ſilver in this Diſeaſe. The Second reaſon, that Quick-ſilver is to be rejected becauſe it is cold, is falſ, for the effects of Quick-ſilver as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, do teach us that it is rather hot then cold. Thirdly, concerning the manner how it works, and cures this Diſeaſe, we ſhal fee hereafter. And though that manner could not be found out, yet the experience muſt not therefore be denied; for there are many Medicines that work by occulr qualities, whoſe manner of acting cannot be perfectly explained. Fourthly, though Quick-ſilver be poyſonous yet 'tis not therefore wholly to be rejected in this diſeaſe, whenas other venenate things come into Phyſical uſe, as opium, Cantharides, Oyl of Scorpions and others. But Fiftly whereas ſome could not be cured by mercurial Medicaments, this is not to be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37365:31"/>aſcribed to the quick-ſilver, but rather to the ignorance of the Phyſitian, who did not rightly apply this Medicine, or to the negligence or diſobedience of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or to the vehemency of the Diſeaſe, which could be overcome by no Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, though the beſt that is.</p>
               <p>But as quick-ſilver is not wholly to be rejected,
<note place="margin">When quick ſilver is to be uſed in the Venereal Diſeaſe.</note> ſo we think it is not unwarily and raſhly to be uſed, but only upon urgent neceſſity, to wit then when this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe could not be cured with Guajacum wood or Sarſaparilla. For we muſt come to the uſe of quick-ſilver for two cauſes eſpecially, the firſt is when the Diſeaſe is ſo ſtubborn, that it wil not yeild to thoſe uſual Medicines: Secondly when there is ſomething preſent, which doth not admit of the uſe of the Decoction of the wood and Sarſaparilla, eſpecially the heat and inflamation of the Kidneys and Liver. And <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi> writes <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15. that he hath cured ſome, who if they had uſed never ſo little of Guajacum, though corrected with cold things, were preſently taken ſo with a heat of Urin, that an Inflamation of thoſe parts ariſing, they have hardly eſcaped death; and therefore in ſuch caſes ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, wil we or nil we, we are compelled to make uſe of quick-ſilver, as the ſame <hi>Rudius</hi> ſpeaketh; and that oftentimes may be done ſafe enough, ſo that he writes he hath anointed with quick-ſilver even infants infected by their Nurſes at ſuck, and hath cured them.</p>
               <p>Yet we muſt not come raſhly and inconſiderately to this unction,
<note place="margin">Things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with Quickſilver.</note> but firſt of al we muſt confider, whether there be any thing preſent that doth prohibit it: for firſt of al unction with quick-ſilver is not admitted, when the ſtrength is but feeble, and therefore in old men it ſeldom takes place. Secondly, if the body do ſtil abound with many vitious Humors, for then the quick-ſilver doth not eaſily penetrate: and by a commotion of the Humors it cauſeth grievous Diſeaſes and Symptomes, therefore the body muſt firſt of al be emptied. Thirdly, if the Air be too hot, and if it be dog daies. Fourthly, if the body be extenuated, if there be a Feaver, Ulcers of the mouth, and inclination to a quinſie; this kind of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine alſo is not convenient for them who before the French Pox, ſuffered numneſs, tremblings, Palſie, and pains in their joynts.</p>
               <p>But that quick-ſilver may rightly be made uſe of,
<note place="margin">Whether Quick ſilver be an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exipharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum of the Venereal Diſeaſe.</note> we muſt firſt of al enquire after what manner it is to be given, and what it can performe, and do in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, on which buſineſs the hinge of this controverſie turnes. Where firſt of al we are not of their opinion, who think quick-ſilver to be an Alexipharmacum of this Diſeaſe. <hi>Quercetan</hi> indeed affirmes it in <hi>Conſil. de lue Vener.</hi> where he writes that Mercury is the only true and ſole Alexipharmacum of this Diſeaſe, eſpecially if it be inveterate. From whom <hi>Felix Platerus</hi> doth not much diſſent, who writes that Mercury by its occult qualities and propriety contrary to this diſeaſe, doth quel the Venenate quality of that diſeaſe, but this cannot ſimply be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for when as there are three things in this Diſeaſe, firſt of al that Malignant quality imprinted on the parts dedicated to nutrition, and eſpecially on the Liver, or an occult Diſeaſe; Secondly, vitious Humors, generated in the Liver evilly affected, and polluted by this Malignity: Thirdly, Diſeaſes and Symptomes which are raiſed every where in the body by thoſe vitious Humors, we do not deny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that Quick-ſilver may conduce ſomwhat to the Evacuating of the vitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, as ſhal be ſaid here after, and hence alſo to the taking away of the Diſeaſes and Symptomes which do ariſe from them; but that it doth overcome the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and virulent diſpoſition it ſelf, which is the property of an Alexipharmacum, is that which we deny. For firſt of al experience doth not confirm it, neither hath that Alexipharmacal vertue of Mercury been hitherto proved by any one, by any ſolid argument; but whatſoever it performes, it doth by ſalivation and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent purging, which is not the property of an Alexipharmacum, for otherwiſe al Medicines purging vitious Humors ſhould be called Alexipharmaca. This rather is manifeſt, that ſome cured by mercurial Medicines, after a long interval of time
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37365:32"/>have relapſed into this Diſeaſe, that occult and Malignant diſpoſition being left in the body. Secondly, that quick-ſilver is no Alexipharmacum, appears alſo by this, becauſe 'tis no way friendly to our body, but rather hurts the brain, Heart, and other Members, and cauſeth moſt grievous Diſeaſes and Symptomes in the jawes, which <hi>Platerus</hi> endeavors in vain to remove from Mercury, and to aſcribe them to the virulency of the ſpittle. For thirdly, Quick-ſilver cauſeth ſalivation, not only in the French pox, but alſo in other bodies, which are not Sick of the French Diſeaſe, and beſides hurts in the mouth, inflamation, Exulceration, Stinks, injuries of the Teeth, which is obvious for every one to experience and obſerve, but that is more conſonant to truth, that quick-ſilver is to be numbered amongſt Evacuating Medicines, whenas 'tis evident by experience, that by benefit of that, many thick, tough and virulent Humors are emptyed by the mouth, ſomtimes alſo by ſweat, or other waies, and that it doth not much good in this Diſeaſe, unleſs ſalivation enſue: therefore when it is applied, it can be uſed only for this end, to evacuate virulent Humors, which being emptied, whenas the Symptomes cauſed by them do vaniſh, 'tis concluded by many, that it may be adminiſtred for the Mitigation of the ſymptoms, when as yet it doth only mitigate or take away the Symptomes by accident, the virulent Humors, on which they depend, being taken away. Which cure notwithſtanding, as <hi>Fernelins</hi> is of opinion, is the cruelleſt of al, and ſo hard, that many would rather periſh of the Diſeaſe, than be cured with ſo great danger, ſo bitter hazard: but that quick-ſilver may be applied to external and contumacious Ulcers, is known to every body.</p>
               <p>But to evacuate vitious Humors it may be uſed three manner of waies;
<note place="margin">How many ways quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver doth Evacuate.</note> either to move by ſtool and vomit; or to cauſe ſweat; or to cauſe Salivation and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Coneerning the giving of quick-ſilver to move by ſtool or vomit is already ſpoken before, and the Chymiſts are large in the praiſe of it; and do extol it with wonderful commendations:
<note place="margin">By ſtool and vomit.</note> and <hi>Crollius</hi> calls Mercury the Balſome of Nature, in which there is both a vertue incarnative, and regenerative, which doth wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully renew, and purge from al impurities, and therefore cals it a divine Medicine: to whom <hi>Beguinus</hi> aſſents, who in <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Tyrocin. Chym. cap.</hi> 3. writes that Mercury is the chiefeſt Alexipharmacum againſt al corruption and putrefaction: from whom though <hi>Platerus</hi> do not wholly diſſent, while he teacheth, that this Diſeaſe may eaſily be cured by purging with Mercury, and truly in no long time, but very ſpeedily, being ſcarce drank twice or thrice, from whence is raiſed a plentiful flux of the belly, and alſo vomiting, ſomtimes alſo ſweat and Urin is provoked: yet he cannot deny, that it doth perform this by a violent irritation of Nature, and not without danger.</p>
               <p>But I would have a Phyſitian rather timorous, than bold and raſh in the uſe of this Medicine,
<note place="margin">'Tis to be given wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> for that which <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaid was the poyſon of al things, <hi>Lib.</hi> 37. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. that wil not ſpare mans body, but offends the ſtomach, Liver, Guts, and al the bowels, and is eſpeciallly an enemy to the Nerves and brain: but though the Chymiſts affirme that being prepared it may grow more mild, and that it may not hurt, they precipitate it, ſublime it, and prepare flowers of it, <hi>Aquilam, Aurum vitae,</hi> and other things; yet though you expel Nature with a fork, ſhe wil ſtil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: for as it was ſaid even now out of <hi>Platerus,</hi> it purges violently and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger: and as <hi>Fernelius Lib. de lue Vener. cap.</hi> 17. writes of this buſineſs, upon the giving of prepared Mercury, (doubtleſs he meant precipitate) preſently from the compaſs of the whol body, Humors of al ſorts break forth upwards and downwards, with ſo great force, and ſo violent, that the ſpirits being exhauſted, and the ſtrength waſted, the ſick do either die preſently, or lie ſome daies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength like unto dead men: ſomtimes al the mouth is inflamed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a Gangreen, putrid Ulcers and very ſtinking, and ſomtimes the jaws ſwel, that the Patient for ſome daies is not able to ſwallow at al: although ſomtimes it work more gently, yet it purges violently enough.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:37365:32"/>
               <p>But if it do work more mildely, either it retaines the nature of that which is crude, or being fixt it doth almoſt put on the nature of a fixt mettal: of the firſt ſort is metcurius dulcis, of which <hi>Angelus Sala</hi> ſaith in the riper aged it works little, unleſs it be given in a great doſe, to wit thirty five grains, and then it eaſily raiſeth ſalivation; and that this is true a certain Phyſitian wel known to me, learnt to his coſt and found it ſo by experience, as we have ſaid <hi>de conſens. et diſſen. cap.</hi> 18. but if it be more fixt, it doth not move the belly; therefore it muſt needs be that it have a middle nature, if it ought to purge, that it may ſtimulate nature, where yet alwaies to hold that medium is very difficult. Yet amongſt thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, we have nominated of prepared mercury, that which is called mercurius vitae doth eaſily challeng the firſt place, ſo that I think it would be needleſs to make mention here of more medicines prepared out of mercury; but we muſt note this concerning mercurious vitae, that it is no pure mercurial medicine, but there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it ſome part of antimony as appears by the vitrum and Regulus, which may be made out of the mercurius vitae, but can by no art be prepared out of mercury alone, but that they may be made of antimony is wel known.</p>
               <p>Yet when we are minded to adminiſter mercurius vitae,
<note place="margin">When it is to be given in the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real diſeaſe,</note> and other mercurial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, we muſt diligently conſider <hi>Meſues</hi> rule, that it is a grane of wiſdom, not to come to ſtrong medicines, but where weak ones wil not ſatiſfy. If therefore this evil be new and gentle which may be cured by gentler purgers, and by the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Guajacum or Sarſaparilla, we muſt not raſhly come to the uſe of quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. But if the evil be ſtubborn and inveterate, and there be many virulent humors in the body, mercurial medicines may be given without danger: for then 'tis not eaſily to be feared, that it ſhould aſſail mans body, when it hath vicious humors enough to work upon. And oftentimes neceſſity compels us to come to the uſe of quickſilver, and ſome do hope in vain, to affect the ſame buiſmeſs by weak medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines often repeated as by ſtronger taken plentifully at once. For experience hath long ſince taught us, that we do oftentimes ſpend our time in vain in ſuch medicines given againſt pertinaceous diſeaſes.

               </p>
               <p>The third way is by Salivation, and many indeed do place al their hopes of the cure of this diſeaſe in Salivation, ſo that <hi>Platerus</hi> writeth, unleſs that in the cure by quickſilvet Salivation be raiſed by the uſe of it. And at laſt be ſupervenient, the cure doth not ſucceed, neither is it fitting ſo much to condemne the uſe of it and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reject it for the faults which happen in the mouth in this cute, or for other accidents, amongſt which convulſions are cheifly to be feared, which are wont ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to happen, if there be any great error committed in the uſe of it, whenas af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the cure the faults of the mouth are eaſily corrected again. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Fernelius de lue Vener. cap.</hi> 6. doth exactly ſet forth this manner of cure and deſcribes its inconveniences: ſo great ſaith he is the cruelty and harſhneſs of this unguent, that the patient preſently begins to languiſh the ſecond or third day; for by its extraordinary tenuity it doth melt and diſſolve, whatſoever is in the ſuperficies and whole compaſs of the body, and at length by its extream cooling faculty with which it is endued, it drives them to the inward parts, from thence into the ſtomach and breaſt, from which afterwards it drives them upwards by a continuity of parts to the throat and mouth, with ſo great and ſo violent an injury, that the teeth, to which as alſo to the brain 'tis peculiarly an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37365:33"/>do in al preſently, grow looſe, and in ſome become blackiſh and al drop out. Some things it diſcuſſes out of the body by ſweat, ſome by its purgative faculty it caſts forth by ſtool, with a great deal of torture. And breifly to comprehend al, al certainly who are thus cured have their jaws exulcerated, their tongue and pallate ſwollen, their gums and teeth looſe, and ſpittle runs through their mouthes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intermiſſion, ſmelling worſe then any ſtink, with ſo great contagion, that the lipps by touching of that contract ulcers, and the cheeks are ulcerated within: the ſtomach being cooled and diſturbed with the ſtink, the ſick are deſtitute of any appetite to meat, and being tormented with into lerable thirſt, yet they are ſcarce able to drink, their whol mouth being but one ulcer.

<note place="margin">When un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with quicksilver is to be uſed.</note> their eares grow deaf, in ſome incurably. Al the houſe about ſtinks.</p>
               <p>And indeed that manner of cure is bitter enough, that one ought not eaſily to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of it, and therefore 'tis not be uſed when the evil is new and light, but when 'tis inveterate and contumacious, and when other remedies as the decoction of Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Sarſaparilla, and the like, have firſt of al been tryed in vain; neither muſt we come to the uſe of that unleſs the body before be diligently purged, leaſt too great a quantity of virulent humors be turned ruſhing to the mouth and jaws; neither is this cure convenient for old men, nor for weak bodies, nor thoſe that are waſted, and are ſick of a weakneſs of the nerves, and have weak heads, and ſubject to dſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, leaſt by the quickſilver, it being hurtful for them, theſe parts be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated.</p>
               <p>Therefore as <hi>Hercules Saxonia de lue. Vener. cap.</hi> 39. writes of this ſubject, they are neither to be approved of who uſe mercurial unctions without any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, neither muſt we hold with them, who wholy reject the uſe of them. For ſomtimes this diſeaſe is ſo contumacious, that 'tis not cured with the decoction of Guajacum taken fifty dayes, and twice or thrice a day, but grows worſe; whenas therefore the patients are weary of taking any more decoctions, and alſo of ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note place="margin">How quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver doth raiſe a flux.</note> and hungring, that they may not be left without al help, 'tis better to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter a dangerous remedy then none at al.</p>
               <p>But what way quickſilver doth raiſe ſalivation, Authors do differ, <hi>Euſtachius Rudius lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de morb. occult. cap.</hi> 15. diſputes at large of this buſineſs, and firſt of al he worthily derides them who hold that quickſilver by its moſt intenſe cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or repreſſing faculty doth repel the humors from the external parts into the innermoſt parts of the body; for repelling thinges are of thick and dry parts but quickſilver is of moſt thin parts: neither do other repeling medicines, nay not the moſt cold ayre, or coldeſt water, performe any ſuch thing; neither can here be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any reaſon, why the repulſion ſhould be to the mouth and not to other parts that are neerer. This therefore muſt be inquired, why quickſilver is moved to the head, and is cheifly purged through the mouth. Many are of opinion, neither doth that diſpleaſe <hi>Platerus,</hi> that quickſilver doth cauſe ſpitting by a peculiar vertue: but he explains not the manner; neither doth this pleaſe <hi>Rudius.</hi> For ſaith he if quickſilver be moved to the head by vertue of its whol ſubſtance, and by a peculiar property, it doth that either by a ſimilitude or contrariety of ſubſtance; it cannot be by a ſimilitude of ſubſtance, becauſe quickſilver doth rather hurt, then befreind the brain and nerves: and therefore as cantharides do invade and offend the bladder, the Sea hare the lungs, ſo alſo in this manner quickſilver ſeems to aſſault the brain. But <hi>Rudius</hi> overthrows that opinion two waies, firſt of al, becauſe he hath proved before mercury, to be no poyſon, ſecondly becauſe he thinks he is able to render a reaſon from the manifeſt qualities, why quickſilver doth aſſault the head; where firſt of al, he ſuppoſeth this that mercury as opium hath heterogeneous parts and that 'tis made up of parts of a different nature, yet ſo, that the hot parts do predominate; and that 'tis compounded of an aery and earthy ſubſtance but very much attenuated with heat, which like unto ſmoak ſcarce enduring the heat, flyes away in fume and is diſperſed. Therfore amongſt al other medicines of this faculty it doth moſt powerfully extenuate the humors, diſcuſs, and convert them to motion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37365:33"/>and therefore doth purge by ſweat, by ſtool, by the mouth, and ſo partly by its purgative vertue, partly by the heat of its thin parts doth draw the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors along with it, and that it happens ſo, that the thinner going to the skin are emptied by ſweat, but the thick and unfit to be emptied by ſweat, being extenuated together with the quickſilver turnd into vapor are drawn up into the head and then cauſing diſtillations do fal down again; and at length he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, whenas quick ſilver outwardly anointed doth not remain in the ſtomach, as other purging medicines do, but aſſails the head; 'tis no wonder if it principally purge by the mouth.</p>
               <p>But indeed he doth not this way ſatisfie the doubt, and this is a great peice of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance both in things phyloſophycal and Chymical. For firſt of al that Quick ſilver cannot be cleared from venenoſety, was ſaid before, and proved, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the contrary anſwered. And <hi>Rudius</hi> himſelf in the chapter even now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, reckons up ſo many and ſo greate evils, which mercury doth cauſe, that they cannot al be reduced to manifeſt qualities: which that I may compendiouſly reduce, Quick ſilver hath a corroding faculty,
<note place="margin">The hurts of Quick ſilver.</note> cauſeth a trembling and weakneſs of the heart, hurts the animal faculty, weakens the ſubſtance of the nerves and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unity, whence are raiſed incurable tremblings and greivous torments, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny uſing of mercurial medicines, have ſuffered cunvulſions, falling ſickneſs, and apoplexy. Nay the ſame <hi>Rudius</hi> reports that ſome after unction have fallen into raving and madneſs: but whereas he endeavors to reduce that operation of mercury by which it cauſeth ſalivation, to the manifeſt qualities in that he laboures in vain, for firſt of al there are no ſuch heterogeneous parts in mercury as he phanſieth, as was ſaid before, neither could any Chymiſt ever yet ſhow them, and whether Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be burnt, or whether it be reduced to water, or what other external forme ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it puts on, it retaines its whole eſſence, and with a litle labour may be reduced to its ancient forme. Beſides <hi>Rudius</hi> renders no reaſon, why Mercury out wardly anoynted on the body, is rather moved to the head then to the ſtomach, and carries the humors thither with it: for whereas he thinks, that it is reſolved into vapour and carried up into the head, tis falſ, whenas it may be collected whol both in the mouth, and in other parts.</p>
               <p>'Tis more agreeable therefore to trueth,
<note place="margin">Quickſilver an Enemy to the nerves</note> that quickſilver is offenſive to the nerves and brain, as the tremblings which it cauſeth do ſufficiently de monſtrate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it creepes up by the nerves to the brain, and carries the vitious humors thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it, which together with the vitious humors whenas nature and the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty of the brain doth expel, and caſt down to the jawes, hence follows ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ivation: and quickſilver whether outwardly applied, or inwardly taken, ſtil creeps up to the head, and cauſeth much ſpitting.</p>
               <p>But there are divers wayes of uſing Quick-ſilver to raiſe a flux,
<note place="margin">The wayes of uſſng quick ſilver</note> to wit either 'tis outwardly applied to the body by unguents, plaiſters, epithems and lavatories ſo called, by a girdle, by bracelets and Rings, by ſuffumigations; or tis taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, by al which ways not withſtanding there is nothing elſe done, but that the Quick-ſilver may be reduced into the ſmalleſt parts that it may the eafier pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the body yet what way ſoever tis broke into peices, it keeps its nature, and the leaſt parts are eaſily again united to one another and returne to their ancient corpulency, that it hath bin obſerved, that ſometimes a great quantity of it hath bin collected in the veins, and cavities of the bones.</p>
               <p>Yet the moſt common way of applying Quick-ſilver is by unction;
<note place="margin">How the unction with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver is to be ordered.</note> but that unction may be performed rightly, ſometimes are to be obſerved before unction, ſome in the anoynting, and ſome after unction, before unction the body, if need require, muſt be emptied either with purging medicines or bleeding: for if very many vitious humors abound in the body, tis to be feared, that by the uſe of theſe unctions they ruſh together in a heap to the jawes and ſuffocate the patient, or being rapt up to the brain do cauſe an apoplexy, or palſie, and therefore firſt of al part of them ought to be emptyed. Alſo if their be plenty of blood, leaſt the patient may
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37365:34"/>ſuffer an inflamation of his jawes or a feaver, tis good to take away a little blood. <hi>Falopius</hi> alſo, that part of the matter may be conſumed, the bowels ſtrengthened, and not be offended by the Quickſilver, gives the decoction of Guajacum eight or ten dayes before unction.</p>
               <p>As concerning the unction it ſelf, the baſis of theſe unguents is Quick-ſilver, which muſt be choſen pure, or vivified by cinnabar, and it muſt be mixed with hogs-greaſe hens-fat, butter, oyl, turpentine that it appeare no longer quick to the ſight, which is commonly called mortifiying of it.
<note place="margin">How Quick ſilver is to be prepared.</note> Some alſo ad to ſix ounces of Quickſilver, four ounces of red ſugar. Some do mix divers other things to correct the malice of Quick-ſilver, and indeed this or that according to the different conſtitution of the diſeaſe, which notwithſtanding profit little. For thoſe oyly and unctuous things, or other things, do ſtick on the skin and ſuperficies of the body, and cannot follow the Quickſilver into the innermoſt parts of the body, nor correct its malignity. But thoſe things which are neceſſarily mixed, are mixt, to that end, that the quickſilver may be reduced into the ſmalleſt bodies and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o may the eaſier inſinuate it ſelf into the body. Some alſo in the compoſition of this unguent, think we ought to have reſpect to divers things: and therefore <hi>Hercules Saxonia,</hi> if there be hard knobs, ads thoſe things which do mollifie, as the ſat and greaſe of geeſe, ducks, the Marrow of oxe bones, butter, oyle of ſweet almons; if there be ulcers he bids us ad drying pouders, Franckincenſe, Myrrh, al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> bids us ad thoſe things, which do reſpect the principal parts, and thoſe that are moſt hurt, and therefore if the joynts be affected he bids us ad ground pine; if the liver, hepatick means; if the ſtomach, things ſtomachical, But beſides the reſt he doth aprove of oyle of Guajacum added to the ointment; al which as we do not wholy diſallow of, ſo they ought to be explained. Firſt of al, if the unction be ordered cheifly for tumors or ulcers, medicines may commodiouſly be mixed with it, but if ſaliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and emptying by ſpittle be cheifly intended there is no need of that laborious compoſition. Secondly Quick-ſilver it ſelf if it be reduced into ſmalleſt parts, doth eaſily penetrate, neither hath it any need of helpers, and there is nothing that can penetrate eaſier then that. Thirdly I can ſcarce be perſwaded, that medicines out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly anointed, can penetrate to the ſtomach and liver, and ſtrengthen them; this likes me beſt, that he thinks oyl of Guajacum ought to be added to thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents.</p>
               <p>The Quantity of Quick-ſilver that is uſed,
<note place="margin">The quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> is ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs, according to the vehemency of the diſeaſe, and the patients ſtrength. Yet we muſt not exceed ſeven ounces which is ſufficient for ſtrong bodies, in weak bodies 'tis ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to uſe three foure or five ounces; but every time uſe two or three ounces; of the unguent, or for every doſe take two ſcruples; in tender children for every place ſo much oyntment as is the bulk of a lentil is ſufficient. Such oyntments therefore may be made thus.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi> commends this form, which he uſed with moſt happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for many yeares at Utine, in the great hoſpital of that City, with ſo much ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that not one of them periſht which he had in cure.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Places which are anointed are the joynts and the ſpaces between, and the leſs fleſhy parts in the hands, elbows, feet, knees, ſometimes in ſtrong bodies the emunctories of the liver are anointed, and the backbone. <hi>Fallopius</hi> expects the hands, and firſt of al anoints the feet tranſverſly about the begining of the feet, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the ſpaces between the joynts of the leg, then the midle of the thighs,
<note place="margin">The time for anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> the middle of the Elbow bones, and the midle of the Armes, afterwards the whole back.</p>
               <p>The moſt commodious time for anointing, is the ſpring and autum, the winter and ſummer are leſs convenient and the unction is to be performed in the morning, upon an empty ſtomach, in a cloſe and warm place, beginning at the lower parts, and ſo paſſing to the upper unction is ſeldom ordered twice on the ſameday.</p>
               <p>The patient anointed muſt either be ropped up in linnen, or the parts anointed be covered with courſe flax or hemp and ſo the patient be placed in his bed.
<note place="margin">How long unction is to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But the unction is to be continued ſo long, til ſalivation or a looſneſs, or ſome other evaccuation ſucceed; and the ſymptomes be leſſened and ceaſe; and truely if a looſneſs follow, it is not ſuddenly to be ſuppreſt, yet we muſt have a care leaſt the guts ſuffer any hurt, caſting in by Clyſter chaly beat milk, or the juyce of pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan with milk, or the decoction of barley and afterwards if need require, come to aſtringent meanes.</p>
               <p>Some think that ſweat alſoought to be moved; but if nature tend to ſalivation, tis not convenient to move ſweat, leaſt there be contrary motions cauſed; but if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her own accord tend to ſweat, tis not to be hindered, yet unction is ſcarce to be continued above three dayes at one time; ſometimes alſo there preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low greivous ſymptomes as great ulcers of the mouth, ſwellings and inflamation of the tongue and jawes, the ſwallowing is hurt, the teeth looſened, an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flux of virulent humors from the mouth, a dia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When unction is now perfected, and the ſpitle runs wel,
<note place="margin">What is to be done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unction.</note> let the parts anointed be waſht with wine, in which ſage, Arabick, lavender, flowers, roſmary, grownd pine, bayleaves, calamint origanum have bin boyled, afterwards lay upon them ſome plaiſter for the nerves.</p>
               <p>At laſt when the unction is paſt, we muſt uſe our endeavor, that the mercury be not left in the body, and that no evil be contracted neither in the mouth nor other parts; and therefore we muſt move ſweat in a Laconick bath keep gold money in the mouth, ſhaveings of gold muſt be dranke, or bullets or pils made up of leaſe gold muſt be ſwallowed: for the mercury is imbibed by the gold, and with it is emptied out of the body, and ſo al evil that might happen is prevented.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:37365:35"/>
               <p>To aſſwage pain, the mouth and jawes muſt be waſhed with warme milk or the Decoction of Barley: to hinder inflamation let the patient uſe the decoction of plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or plantaine water, or of Vine leaves, with the ſyrup of Mulberries and dry roſes, the teeth muſt be waſhed with the decoction of ſage, or with Sage, colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine water, or auſtere wine; after unction we muſt not preſently deſiſt from the cure, but the decoction of Guajacum as being the alexipharmacum of this diſeaſe, muſt be drank ſtil for certain days, which if it be intermitted, a relapſe is wont eaſily to follow upon it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Mercurial plaiſters.</note> emplaſters made of mercury are wont to be applyed in this diſeaſe, which though they cauſe leſs trouble, yet they are leſs effectual to empty by ſpitting. They are prepared of the ſame matter of which the ointments are, to which alſo we may ad cinnabar: but quickſilver either is mixt with uſual plaiſters, as diachylum Ireatum, melilot, or new ones are compounded. The plaiſter called de ranis with mercury, is alſo in uſe. Theſe plaiſters are ſpred upon linnen cloth, leather, and are applyed to the ſame places as the ointments, eſpecially to the hands and feet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the emunctories, and ſomtimes to the back bone, and they are worne continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally night and day, and every third or fourth day are renewed: this cure is leſs troubleſome, and upon faire daies the patient may go abroad, yet the cure is not ſo perfect, and therefore muſt be continued longer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Lavatoris of mercury.</note> Linnen clothes wet in mercury water, are applyed to the ſame places in the forme of an epitheme, and becauſe ſublimate is moſt commodiouſly diſſolved in water, the ſame places which are wont to be anointed, are beſmeared with mercury diſſolved in this manner, which medicines are commonly called lavatories, which are prepared of mercurius ſublimate one ounce, which is diſolved in two pound of ſome liquor.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>For Examples ſake.</head>
                  <p>Take <hi>of Mercury ſublimate one ounce; of Scabious, Roſe, Fumitory water, each eight ounces; Sage water four ounces. Let them boyl and be mixed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſe of it is this, with a cloth wet in this liquor, let the knees and feet be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared, and the armes from the elbow towards the hands, and that muſt be done in the morning and towards the evening, in a warme place and continued for ten days, til ſpitting follow.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Mercurial girdles and bracelets.</note> Girdles and bracelets are made of Mercury killed with ſpittle and mixt with the white of an egg, which mixture is ſpred upon cotton, and that is ſowed into leather or cloath, and of that girdles or bracelets are made.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Alſo this diſeaſe is cured by ſuffumigations made of quickſilver, but this way of cure is more dangerous than that by unction,
<note place="margin">Suffumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of mercury.</note> nay it hath been deadly to ſome, and therefore is not to be made uſe of, unleſs al other meanes have been tried in vain, and only on very ſtrong bodies; for this way of cure is very violent, whenas the patients that do admit of it, every day are wont to voide ten pints of virulent ſpittle; but it takes not place in thoſe that are weak, waſted, endewed with a hot and dry diſtemper, not in thoſe, which are troubled with a difficulty of breathing, or are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to diſtillations from the head on the breaſt, or who ſpit blood, or are taken with a lientery, or dyſentery: but phyſitians do cheifly uſe thoſe ſuffumigations in a contumacious French ophthalmy, and upon an imminent ſhedding of the haire, which cannot be hindred by other medicines; for this ſuffumigation doth faſten the haire. Yet then a particular ſuffumigation may be appointed.</p>
                  <p>For we muſt note here,
<note place="margin">Their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> that there is difference of ſuffumigations in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; for ſome are univerſal which are received by the whol body, and therefore alſo do empty the whol body; others partitular, which are applyed only to certain parts: again ſome ſuffumigations are prepared of benigne medicines, as frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, myrrh, oyl, Cinamon, Styrax calamite, ſpikenard, Amber, Ammonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, benjamin, wood of aloes, Amber greeſe, Musk, Gallia moſchata, and the like, which though they may be fitted for the uſe of certaine parts, yet they do not deſtroy the venereal diſeaſe.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:37365:35"/>
                  <p>Thoſe therefore which are proper to this diſeaſe, are chiefly prepared of mercury and of thoſe things made of Mercury, cinnabar, Mercury precipitate, ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
                  <p>As concerning thoſe univerſal ones, their baſis as was ſaid even now, is mercury any way prepared; ſome ad the Greeks Sandarach, and yellow arſnick, but whenas they are moſt pernicious poyſons, they are not ſafe enough applyed, neither do they cure this diſeaſe in particular that we may give you ſome formes.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Of Factitious Cinnabar three ounces; Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Maſtich,

Epiphanius Ferdinandus</hi> reports the following forme is much in uſe at <hi>Naples</hi> in the Hoſpital for thoſe that are incurable.</p>
                  <p>Take, <hi>of Litharge five ounces; of antimony, Cinnabar, each one ounce; of Pontick Rhubarb ſix ounces; Polipody of the oake three ounces. Sweet cane, Cinamon, Laudanum, Roſes, Mace, Nutmegs, Alum, Verdegrece, Aloe, each three drams; Red lead, the Greeks Sandarache, each one ounce. Gumme caranna, two drams; Water of Roſes and Citron Flowers, as much as is ſufficient, mix them according to art.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it ſeemes to me to be a forme made up without al reaſon which containes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things unprofitable, and alſo hurtful.</p>
                  <p>That is ſafer which <hi>Ferdinandus</hi> himſelf propoſeth.</p>

For we muſt carefully obſerve, that the patient faint not, which doth often happen; if it be collected by his ſtammering ſpeech, he muſt preſently be taken forth and be refreſht with fitting medicines. But that faintings may be prevented, the patient may be permitted to draw the cold ayre by intervals through a reed, and put forth his noſe without the pavilion.</p>
                  <p>But theſe ſuffumigations are applied either once or twice a day and indeed for three, ſix, or nine or more daies, according as the purgation doth ſooner or later ſucceed, for when this comes, or a looſneſs, we muſt preſently ſeaſe from the ſuffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation. After the patient hath ſweat ſufficiently under his tent. Being wrapt up in linnen he muſt be laid in his bed, that he may there continue his ſweat for an houre or two.
<note place="margin">Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſuffumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But particular ſuffumigations are not applyed to the whol body, but only to

                  <p>Laſt of al alſo a flux may be raiſed by taking Quick-ſilver inwards which though it was not known to <hi>Fernelius,</hi>

Such are thoſe Pills called Barbaroſſa which have Quick-ſilver in them; but Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians give Pills made of Mercury ſo, that at one doſe there is given ſix or ſeven grains of Mercury, and they give them almoſt every day, and ſo long, til a flux followeth, and this cure they continue for thirty daies. Yet <hi>Platerus</hi> admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that this kind of cure is not eaſily to be admitted, and not unleſs the Diſeaſe be inveterate, when other Medicines premiſed availe nothing. He alſo thinks that it is commodious, if it be preſently caſt forth by ſtool either by its own weight, or by the admiſtion of other things; but if that be done, doubtleſs it wil not cauſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation; therefore 'tis better that Mercury what way ſoever prepared, be given in a leſs doſe, than can cauſe purging either by vomit, or ſtool: viz. that the half, or third, or fourth part only of that doſe be given, which otherwiſe is wont to be given to purge. For example ſake, precipitate or Turbith Mineral is wont to be given at other times to vomit or purge to the weight of ſix grains, but if only three, or two, or one be given, by the continued uſe of it a flux is raiſed: and therefore he that would uſe ſuch Medicines, ſhal do very right, if firſt of al he give the ful doſe of the Mercurial Medicine to purge, the ſecond day half ſo much, the third day a third part, the fourth day a fourth part, and continue ſo, til the ſpittle run, yet he need not ſo preciſely obſerve it: and tis altogether ſafer in this diſeaſe to give thoſe Mercurial Medicines, which do not move the belly with great violence, nor ſo great danger, yet by their continued uſe do provoke ſpitting.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Of the Diet to be obſerved in the Cure of the Venereal Diſeaſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Diet in the cure of this Diſeaſe is ſtrictly to be obſerved;
<note place="margin">Diet. The Air.</note> firſt of al let the Air in which the Patient is converſant, be hot, that inſenſible tranſpiration may be free, and ſweating be not hindred, but rather promoted, yet not ſo hot, as to make faint. Therefore if need require let the patient keep himſelf in a warm cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the whol time or his cure, and let not him expoſe himſelf to the free Ayre, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be ſomwhat hot by reaſon of the ſeaſon of the year, and then not before noon. Yet they whoſe courſe of life wil not allow them to keep at home, let them guard themſelves with Cloaths againſt external cold, and as much as they can ſhun the cold Air.</p>
               <p>As concerning their Meat,
<note place="margin">The Meat. Whether a ſlender diet be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the Venereal diſeaſe.</note> there is much diſcourſe indeed every where in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe concerning a ſlender Diet: but whenas a ſlender Diet is that which doth in ſome ſort impair the ſtrength, or which doth little preſerve the enfeebled ſtrength, ſuch diet is only convenient in acute diſeaſes, which whenas they laſt not long, the ſtrength alſo ſomwhat debilitated is able to hold out to the end of them: but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the French pox is a Chronical diſeaſe, and the Cure is extended for many weeks, if the ſtrength be dejected by a ſlender diet, it cannot hold out till the end of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. But that Phyſitians do chiefly feed their Patients with bread and raiſons, I think this is the cauſe, becauſe they would give the moſt ſimple food, and that of good juyce: for whenas variety of meats doth eaſily ſupply vitious humors, and fleſh, and fiſh, and the like meats are more eaſily corrupted, then bread and raiſons
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37365:36"/>they prohibit the ſick variety of meats and fleſh, and would have them contented only with bread and raiſons: therefore that courſe and form of diet is to be obſerved which may ſuffice for the conſervation of ſtrength, though not to encreaſe it, but muſt no way oppreſs Nature. The meat alſo muſt be of good juyce, and ſimple, and which no waies affords matter for the generation of excrements, nor may call away Nature from reſiſting the Diſeaſe to the concoction of that. And therefore the patient muſt not be allowed above two diſhes, and meat muſt be given but twice aday; therefore when the ſick is prepared for the uſe of Medicines, let his diet be ſuch which may not impair his ſtrength, but rather preſerve it, nay, in ſome ſort encreaſe it, that the patient may afterwards be able to undergo the evacuations that ſhal be ordered, and a more ſlender diet: but when Sweaters or Quick-ſilver is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, if the ſtrength wil bear it, we muſt uſe a more ſpare diet, leſt the vertue of the Medicines be hindered by plenteous nouriſhment, and let the ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the body be rather waſted, than heaped up, and let the paſſages by which they ought to be expelled, be al kept free and open: but let not the diet be too ſlender, leſt the ſtrength fail, but be able to hold out til the perfect cure of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which is wont to be long firſt; and though ſomwhat is to be bated of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary diet in the cure of this diſeaſe, yet that is not to be done preſently at the beginning, nor that change is not ſuddenly to be made; but the firſt eight daies by little and little, ſomwhat muſt be ſubſtracted from the accuſtomary diet; as alſo the laſt eight daies of the Cure, by degrees he muſt return to the former courſe of diet; yet we muſt alwaies have reſpect unto the ſtrength, and diligently conſider what that is able to endure, and we muſt have a greater care of that, than of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as without which the Cure cannot be perfected.</p>
               <p>But how much concerns the quantity of the meat, we muſt alſo reſpect the ſtrength, and the diſeaſe; for by now much the ſtrength is ſtronger, by ſo much 'tis able to ſuffer the leſs quantity of meat; but the ſtrength is demonſtrated by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the body, the temperament, cuſtom, the age, ſeaſon of the year, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and condition of the ſick; of which we have ſpoke in its proper place. In brief, as much as poſſible may be, ſomwhat muſt be bated of the accuſtomary food, which alſo the people of <hi>India,</hi> from whom the manner of curing this diſeaſe was derived to us, are reported to do; yet ſo, that alwaies reſpect be had unto the ſtrength: For if the patient be ſtrong, his Body of a cold conſtitution, that he can eaſily endure hunger; fleſh is not to be given any more after eight daies, but the patient muſt be content with bread and raiſons: but if the ſtrength be weak, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſlender, cholerick, ſome fleſh alſo may be granted, viz. the fleſh of Chickens, Hens, Partridges, Veal, Kid, and tender weather, as alſo Hens Eggs: but Hogs fleſh which is hard of digeſtion and diſtribution, and doth encreaſe the morbifick matter, is chiefly to be eſchewed; as alſo corruptible Fruits, and ſoft fiſhes: and truly the moſt commodious Food in this diſeaſe, is raiſons, and to be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alother meats: beſides, they do not eaſily putrefie, and they afford good juyce and nouriſhment, and correct the malignity of the vitious Humors; whence ſome are of Opinion, That Raiſons in this Diſeaſe are not only meat, but medicine too; and eſpecially thoſe greater ones called <hi>Cybebae,</hi> are moſt profitable, in which there is greater plenty of nouriſhment, and a more abſterſive and ſtrengthening faculty.</p>
               <p>Concerning bread here is ſome doubt; many commend Bisket,
<note place="margin">What kind of bread is to be given.</note> nay admit of that only, which as we do not diſallow of in ſtrong bodies, which are moiſt and abound with flegm and excrements, being inclined rather to putrrefaction, then aduſt, and in thoſe who have ſtrong teeth, and are accuſtomed to it: ſo alſo Bread once wel baked, and not too moiſt, may ſafely be permitted, as a nouriſhment moſt familiar to al Natutes, Sexes, Ages and any ſeaſon of the year: neither muſt we cauſe any trouble to the patient, by forbidding common bread, if he deſire that rather then Bisket: nay Bisket ſeems to have its diſcommodities; for it ſtaies longer in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and is not ſo eaſily diſgeſted, and for the right diſgeſting of it there is need of a greater ſtrength of the ſtomach, which notwithſtanding for the moſt part in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37365:37"/>thoſe that are ſick of the French Pox is very languid: beſides whenas in thoſe ſick of the Venereal Diſeaſe for the moſt part aduſt Humors do abound, by Bisket they are increaſed, on the contrary by common bread as being more moiſt they are made remperate, and at length more nouriſhment and good blood is afforded from it, as being beſt tempered, and in meats that which is beſt tempered, is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is intemperate.</p>
               <p>Many alſo do weigh out the quantity of the meat, and write that at one meale, four ounces of bread, and two or three ounces of fleſh wil ſuffice; but this cannot be ſo accurately obſerved in al men, but here there is no ſmal regard to be had to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and cuſtome.</p>
               <p>As concerning their drink,
<note place="margin">Their drink</note> Authors alſo do not fully agree concerning that, ſome think nothing is to be given for drink but the decoction of Guaiacum and Sarſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla, and wholly forbid wine, and think tis as much to be denied in this Diſeaſe, as in a pleuriſie, and are of opinion that wine is not ſo much as to be taſted of, the whol courſe of the cure; and <hi>Fernelius</hi> writes that wine is ſo averſe to Guajacum, as tis to Hemlock, <hi>de lue Vener. cap.</hi> 13, But for this cauſe chiefly they forbid Wine, becauſe the body and Humors which before were aduſt, and which grow hot by the uſe of Guajacum, by the uſe of wine are inflamed. But indeed this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeems not ſufficient; for that Second decoction may heat as much; as wine, if it be thin and dilute and moderately drank: therefore the ſtrength is here to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and whenas wine hath a notable agreement with our body, and doth ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the heart and al parts, and eſpecially the ſtomach, is moſt eaſily diſtributed into the whol body, doth moſt ſpeedily nouriſh, and ſo fortifie Nature, that it may the better be able to oppoſe the Diſeaſe; the uſe of it is not ſimply to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, eſpeciallly in thoſe who are leſs hot, and have a flegmatick body ſtuft up with crude Humors; yet the uſe of wine is ſo to be moderated, that it do no way inflame the body; but thoſe that can abſtaine from wine without any hurt, let them drink that ſecond decoction made of Guajacum and that plentifully at meals, and other times, when they are thirſty, yet they to, may ſomtimes take a drauft of wine to ſtrengthen the ſtomach. After the ſame manner if the Cure be ordered by Quick-ſilver, at that time when Evacuation is not yet made by the mouth and ſpitting, and the patient can chaw meat, he muſt be nouriſht with the beſt bread and good fleſh, and dilute wine muſt be given him: but when Salivation begins, and the Patient can chaw no longer, by reaſon of the looſneſs of his teeth, he muſt be nouriſht with ſuppings, and Barly Ptiſſan, and fleſh broaths with bread in it, and whenas an Inflamation of the jaws is feared, he muſt abſtain from wine. But after the cure is finiſht, though the Patient may reurne to his accuſtomary Diet, yet tis moſt convenient that he be nouriſhed with meats of good juyce, from which the beſt blood may be generated; for whenas the body is extenuated, and the veins emptied, we muſt wholly take care, that the body or Veſſels be not filled with vitious blood, but tis commodious that they be reſtored and filled with good. Neither muſt it be granted, that upon recovery he preſently ariſe from a ſmal quantity of meat, to a great, whenas al change to extreames is dangerous. And when it may be feared, that the Liver be heated by the uſe, of hot and dry Medicines, conſerve of Roſes, Violets, the pouders of the three ſaunders, Diarrhodon Abbat. muſt be given for ſome weeks; and let the courſes of diet, eſpecially in Summer time, be cooler, provided chiefly of Barley, the Whey of Goats Milk alſo is good. But if there be any fear, that ſome reliques ſtil and Malignant diſpoſition of this diſeaſe be remaining in the body,
<note place="margin">Wine of Guajacum.</note> give a Phyſick wine made with Guajacum and Sarſaparilla which is moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly prepared at vintage time, if to every Gallon of wine one pound of Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, and three ounces of Sarſaparilla be added, and let cool with the new wine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the accuſtomed manner; but out of vintage time thoſe Medicines may only be ſteeped in Wine.</p>
               <p>Sleep is not only convenient in the night,
<note place="margin">Sleep.</note> but alſo a day times, when the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſweat, it may be granted.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:37365:37"/>
               <p>Al violent exerciſe is hurtful;
<note place="margin">Exerciſe.</note> for whenas the ſtrength is impared by it and there is a greater tranſpiration and diſſolution of the body, thence it comes to paſs, that the patient cannot be content with that ſmaller portion of nouriſhment, which is wont to be uſed, in this Diſeaſe. But he muſt wholly abſtaine from Venery, as the greateſt enemy to this Diſeaſe: let ſweating in his Chamber be inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and frictions which may be done with the ſame labor when the ſweat is wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of: let the affection of his mind be compoſed to mirth.</p>
               <p>We muſt uſe our endeavor that the belly be kept looſe,
<note place="margin">Excrements</note> and whenas by reaſon of the ſmal quantity of meat it is wont eaſily to be bound, it muſt be looſned with Clyſters, and Raiſons with leaves of Seny; nay by intervals to give ſome purgers is not only profitable, but alſo neceſſary: for though thoſe Laxatives do empty the firſt paſſages, yet becauſe they reach not to the more diſtant places, and by ſweaters only the thinner parts are Evacuated, but the thick are left behind, tis good after ſeven or ten daies, or after a longer ſpace, or need requires, to give a purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine agreeable to the body of the Patient.</p>

                  <p>As concerning the Ulcers of the Yard eſpecially,
<note place="margin">The Cure of Venereal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers in the Yard.</note> which are very common in this Diſeaſe, we have ſpoke of them in general <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Pract. Part.</hi> 9. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. that we may add a little, the Root of the Yard being guarded with a defenſive Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Ulcer muſt be waſht with the Decoction of Scabious, Horehound, and eſpecially Soape-wort, and Guajacum: afterwards let the Ulcer be anointed with ſome convenient unguent; thoſe Oyntments are chiefly profitable, which have Mercury in them, either a live, or ſublimate, or precipitate, or Cinnabar. And in Ulcers of the Yard, and rottenneſs of the Nut, as they ſpeak <hi>Hercules Saxonia</hi> writes there is no Medicine yet found out more profitable then precipitate: yet it ought not to be applied, but where there is a thick filth, but in clean Ulcers tis not to be uſed <hi>Euſtachius Rudius Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Morb. occult. Cap.</hi> 19. commends two Oyntments eſpecially. The firſt is:</p>

<note place="margin">The Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</note> Oyntment of Rozin (which is made of pure oyl, Rozin of the Pine, Turpentine, and Yellow Wax) ſix drams; Mercury Precipitate, one dram; a little Wax.

                  </p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:37365:38"/>
                  <head>The other is this.</head>
                  <p>Take <hi>of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Oyntment of Roſes, of each three ounces: new wax, one ounce: Mercury precipitate half an ounce. Mix them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thoſe Oyntments are good not only for the Ulcers of the Yard, but for French Ulcers of other parts, for the Diſeaſe called Ficus, ſwellings in the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daments, and Cruſts.</p>
                  <p>The Balſame of Mercury alſo is good, which is thus prepared.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>of Quick ſilver diſſolved in ſpirit of Nitre, to one pound of this diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pour of Oyl of Olives, three ounces. Let them ſtand and digeſt eight daies, afterwards ſeparate the oyl and keep it for your uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, Take <hi>the Yelk of one Egg boyled hard, Honey one ounce. Mix them over a gentle fire, let them boyl, and add of Mercury Sublimate, half a dram.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After mundification this Oyntment alſo may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>of the beſt aloe, half an ounce; Crocus Martis, two drams; Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, red Lead, of each one dram; Honey, half an ounce; Turpentine, two drams; the Yelk of an Egg. Mix them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But occult and hidden ulcers are wont to lie hid either bound up under the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin,
<note place="margin">Hidden <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</note> or elſe are in the internal paſſage of the Yard; if the Ulcer be under the fore-skin contracted, either a convenient medicine is to be injected by a ſyringe, and afterwards a tent dipt in oyntment is with a probe to be applied to the part affected or the fore-skin muſt be cut long waies, and neceſſary Medicines be layed to it.</p>
                  <p>But if the ulcers be in the very paſſage of a mans Yard,
<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers in the paſſage of the Yard.</note> they are hard to be cured, and have caruncles joyned with them, or fleſhy excreſſences, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the emiſſion of the urine, therefore in a ſlight ulcer, we muſt inject Plantane water, in which Alum, litharge, and white Lead have been boyled, but in more grieous ulcers uſe this Liniment.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>of Mercury precipitate, one ounce; Mercury ſublimate, one dram; burnt lead, two drams. Grind them on a Marble ſtone, waſh them often with Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, and let them dry in the ſhade. Afterwards take of Hogs Fat, ſix ounces; White Wax, two drams. Let them be diſſolved over the fire, and add the pouder, and two ſcruples of Camphire. Make a Limment, which muſt be beſmeared over a Candle made of five ounces of White Wax, and one ounce of Turpentine, and let the Candle be put up into the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinary paſſage: or let ſome convenient plaiſter wrapt over a ſmal probe, be thruſt in: the Caruncle being taken away a drying and conſolidating oyntment muſt be caſt in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if there be an ulcer in the womb,
<note place="margin">In the womb</note> and that ſordid and creeping, the evil is incurable: but the ſlighter are cured by injections of Alum waters, in which Guajacum and Sarſaparilla is boyled, or with peſſaries of the juyce of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, with pouder of Aloes, Bole Armenick, white Lead and the like. In a very ſordid ulcer the Oyntment Aegyptiacum may be added, or ſome Mercurial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent: and at laſt a drying and conſolidating Oyntment may be uſed, as that of Tutty, or the like.</p>
                  <p>In more grieous ulcers ſuffumigations of the Womb are moſt profitable, but whenas the Pipes are overheated by the coals, theſe candels of <hi>Hercules Saxonia</hi> are good for a fume.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>of Styrax, Calamite, Beniamin, of each ſix drams; wood of Aloes, ſeven ſcruples; white Frankincenſe, one ounce; Ladanum, one dram and an half; Orrice, Cloves, of each two drams; Damask Roſes. ſix drams; Cinnabar, two drams; coales of Willow, half a pound; Aqua Vitae as much as is ſufficient. Make Candels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the ſame Medicines the ulcers of the Guts are Cured.</p>
                  <p>But to the ulcers of the jaws whenas ſuch Medicines cannot be applied make a Gargariſme of the Decoction of Sarſaparilla,
<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer of the Jaws.</note> the bark of Guajacum, the Leaves
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37365:38"/>of plantane, ſcabious, mittle, red roſes, pomegranate pil, ſumach, to which ad a little alume the decoction may be made in water, and towards the end ad a little auſtere wine; after they are waſht, the ulcers muſt be clenſed with oyl of ſulphur, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a convenient liquor, or the compound water of alum, which is thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>of mercury ſublimate, roch allum, each one ounce;
<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of alum.</note> Grind them on marble ſtone, then ad to them juyce of Lemons three ounces, plantane water one pound and an half; roſe water nine ounces; Boyl them in a glaſs to the conſumption of the fifth part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you muſt have a care, that no part of ſuch medicines be ſwallowed down; but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of antimony ſo called is very efficacious, if the ulcer be gently touched with a piece of cotton moiſtned with the butter; but there is need of the ſame caution here: but whenas it cannot alwaies be prevented, but ſomewhat wil ſlide into the ſtomach, and ſo ſuch medicines cannot be given ſafely enough; but on the contrary, other more gentle medicines are of little efficacy, theſe ulcers are hard to be cured, nay oftentimes are incurable; the ſolution of gold is more ſafely applied to theſe ulcers, prepared after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>fifteen leaves of Gold, roch alume, nitere, Salt, each one ounce; grind them on marble, and poure to it ſome drops of ſpirits of vitriol; afterwards poure on it ſpirits of wine two fingers bredth above it, and let them ſtand in warm aſhes, laſt of al boyl, that the leaves of the gold may be diſſolved, and the ſpirits of wine grow yellow. Seperate the Spirits of wine by diſtillation, then poure more on again and digeſt it, and do this ſo often, til the ſpirits of wine diſſolve the gold, and the ſalts be left at the bottom; at laſt ſeperate the ſpirits of wine by diſtillation till tis dry, and pour on ſpirits of turpintine and digeſt it eight dayes in a warm place, till the gold be diſſolved, with this ſolution waſh the part affected twice every day.</hi>

                  <p>Concerning buboes which are wont often to break forth in the groines in the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal diſeaſe, we muſt hold faſt this in general, that we do our endeavor,
<note place="margin">The cure of buboes.</note> to help the expulſion of that matter, which nature aſſayes and indeavors to thruſt forth to the more ignoble parts; whenas ſometimes by this evacuation nature is wont to free
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37365:39"/>her ſelf from al that diſeaſe; therefore if a buboe break not forth enough, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth but tendeth not to ſuppuration, we muſt uſe our endeavor to draw it forth and ſuppurate it. Therefore the thigh of the ſame ſide muſt be rubbed, and ſcatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the lower part, or elſe a vein muſt be opened about that place; but on the bubo it ſelf there muſt be layd ſtrong drawing medicines. As,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>of ſagapen, Ammoniacum each three drams; opoponax, Bdellium, each two drams; muſtard, pepper, Pellitory of ſpain of each one dram; blacke ſope half one ounce; mix them and with wax and pitch, make an emplaſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet if nature be oppreſt with the plenty of virulent matter, that it cannot expel it al, then 'tis good to give a purge, that part of the butthen being taken off, nature may the eaſier expel the reſt.</p>
                  <p>When the tumor hath broke forth enough, we muſt take care it be ſpeedily open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and be kept open a long while; that it may ſuppurate we muſt lay on it thoſe maturatives, which are wont to be applied in inflamations, of the mucilage of mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, marſh-mallows, wheat and flax ſeed, figs, hogs-greaſe, gooſe-greaſe, and the like; or the ſimples diachyled, or that compound with gums; when 'tis mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, we muſt not expect that the bubo ſhould open of it ſelf, but it muſt be opened betimes, leaſt the virulent humor detained there do hurt other parts; the tumor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened the forementioned digeſtives and abſterſives muſt be layd on, to which there wil be need ſometimes to ad a little of mercury precipitate, and the ulcer muſt be kept open a long time.</p>
                  <p>Yet in cold buboes there is no ſuch feare, that the matter ſhould aſcend to other parts, but if purgers and ſweaters, and proper alexipharmaca be applied, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the bubo doth wholly vaniſh without any danger.</p>

                  <p>Take <hi>Of the plaiſter diachylum with gums one ounce; fimple diachylum half an ounce; mercury killed with ſpittle one ounce, oyl of guajacum as much as is ſufficient make aplaſter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Gout is by the Greeks called <hi>Arthritis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Its Name.</note> from <hi>Arthron</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a Joynt; but by the Latines it is termed, <hi>Morbus</hi> or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor Articularis;</hi> and by us in Engliſh it hath its Name from the place affected, and in general is called the Gout. The more Barbarous among the Latin Phyſitians cal it <hi>Gutta,</hi> becauſe that this Malady is excited by a flux, made as it were drop by drop. And there are likewiſe of the more Modern writes, who follow theſe; yea they prefer this Appellation before all other whatſoever; but yet not ſo rightly, as anon, in the firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, we ſhall ſhew you.</p>
               <p>But now,
<note place="margin">Arthron <hi>what it is.</hi>
                  </note> albeit that <hi>Arthron</hi> (as by the Author of the <hi>Medicinal Definitions</hi> and <hi>Introduction</hi> it is defined,) be the <hi>Compages</hi> and Compoſition of the Bones, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the motion of the ſeveral parts; yet here notwithſtanding in this place, by the word <hi>Articulus,</hi> or joynts, we are not to underſtand the very <hi>Compages</hi> of the bones; and the <hi>Syntheſis</hi> or Union of them; or the Extremities of the Bones that are conjoyned; or the ſpace betwixt the Bones, which are Joyned together by the joynt: but the parts that Joyn the very Joynt together, and encompaſs it; eſpecially ſuch of the parts as are endued with ſenſe, to wit, the Membrans, Membranous Ligaments, the extremities of the Muſcles, and the Nerves that are inſerted in theſe parts.</p>
               <p>But in regard that the Joynts are various, from the difference of theſe,
<note place="margin">The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the the gout, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the Joynts.</note> and from the variety of the parts affected, the Gout (which the Greeks cal <hi>Arthritis</hi>) hath alſo received divers and different Names; and if the Feet be affected, it is called <hi>Podagra;</hi> if the Hands, <hi>Chiragra;</hi> if the Hip, <hi>Iſchias;</hi> if the Knee, <hi>Gonagra;</hi> and many other of theſe words, derived from the place affected, and the Greek word <hi>Agra</hi> which ſignifieth a taking or ſeizing upon; ſo that <hi>Podagra</hi> is nothing elſe but the taking of the Feet; and <hi>Chiragra</hi> the taking of the Hands; in regard that theſe members are in this Diſeaſe as it were taken, and by it enſnared, and held faſt: even as by <hi>Lucian</hi> (in his <hi>Tragopodagra</hi>) the Gout is brought in thus ſpeaking:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the moſt of Men I am called</hi> Podagra, <hi>being the taking, and deteining of the Feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the other Joynts it hath no ſpecial name, but by a common and general name it is called <hi>Arthritis,</hi> that is, the Gout; like as alſo in general, it is then called <hi>Arthritis,</hi> when at one and the ſame time a pain ſeizeth upon many of the Joynts together. But the truth is, that ſome certain men there have been who have feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; made very many ſuch like words as theſe; and among the reſt, <hi>Ambroſe Parry,</hi> (in his firſt Chapter of the Gout:) and if the Malady be in the Joynt of the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they call it <hi>Siagonagra;</hi> if in the Neck, <hi>Trachelagra;</hi> if in the <hi>Spina Dorſi</hi> or Back-bone, <hi>Richiſagra;</hi> if in the ſhoulder, <hi>Omagra;</hi> and if in the Joynt of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37365:42"/>Elbow, they term it <hi>Pechyagra.</hi> But we meet with no ſuch Names as theſe in any of the Greek Authors; neither indeed are they commonly uſed; although that theſe Grecians themſelves tel us very often that the <hi>Arthritis</hi> may be generated in many parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo (in his 27. <hi>B. Chap.</hi> 1.) we meet with the word <hi>Mentagra,</hi> at firſt invented (as he ſaith) in ſport,
<note place="margin">Mentagra <hi>what it is.</hi>
                  </note> and merriment, (for it is a vitious medley Compoſition of a word, from a Latin and a Greek word, and ſuch as the learned are never wont to make uſe of) but ſoon after notwithſtanding it became common: but the truth is, that Affect belongs not to the <hi>Arthritis</hi> or Gout; but it was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain foulneſs and naſtineſs of the face, and a kind of Scabbineſs, perteining, and to be referred unto the <hi>Lichenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Latines have likewiſe reteined the Greek words, ſince that even from them they received the diſeaſe alſo. Touching which <hi>Pliny</hi> in his B. 26. Chapter, 10. The <hi>Podagra</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Was wont to be a Diſeaſe more Rare, and not only a ſtranger unto the memories of our Fathers and Grand-Fathers, but even unto our own alſo. For had it been anciently known in</hi> Italy, <hi>it had ere this time received a Latin Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding it is here to be obſerved, that although the word <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagra</hi> be properly taken for the pain of the Feet; Yet ſomtimes alſo (as even <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> in his 253 <hi>Conſil.</hi> confeſſeth) by an appellation borrowed from one Member, the word <hi>Podagra</hi> is to be taken and underſtood for every kinde of Gout in what part ſoever; in regard that ſo it is wont to happen, that the Feet for the moſt part, in the firſt place, and more frequently are taken, and affected with this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and they alſo are very ſeldom free, when the other joynts are affected. And hence it is alſo, that <hi>Lucian</hi> inſcribeth that <hi>Dialogue</hi> of his, which is touching the <hi>Arthritis</hi> or Gout in general, by the name of <hi>Trag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>podagra.</hi> And ſo they that have written in praiſe of the Gout <hi>Podagra</hi> (as <hi>Cardanus,</hi> and others) they all of them ſeem to treat of <hi>Arthritis</hi> or the Gout in general. Yea and certain Phyſitians there are that treat properly of <hi>Arthritis</hi> or the Gout in General, and yet they inſcribe theſe their Tracts, <hi>de Podagra,</hi> or of the Gout (in ſpecial) of the Feet.</p>
               <p>To wit,
<note place="margin">What place the Gout moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeth.</note> moſt frequently this pain invadeth the Feet; and indeed moſt of al, and in the firſt place, the great Toe of the Foot. For Nature (as much as ſhe is able) is wont to drive forth the vitious Humors unto the extream and remote parts; and the Feet are likewiſe more remote from the Fountain of heat; and they are alſo more in motion, by which the Humors are drawn unto them. And from hence it is that <hi>Galen</hi> (in the ſixth <hi>Sect.</hi> of the <hi>Aphoriſms, Apheriſm.</hi> 28.) writeth, that al thoſe that are troubled with the Gout, that is to ſay, with the pains of all the Joynts, they are firſt of all taken with the Gout <hi>Podagra,</hi> or the Gout in the Joynts of the Feet. This indeed for the moſt part ſo happeneth, but yet not alwaies. For in ſome the Gout begins in their Hands; and ſome have it firſt in their Knee, and in ſome it beginneth in ſome other of the Joynts. And albeit that it firſt of al ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Feet, yet notwithſtanding it afterwards alſo for the moſt part invadeth the Joynts of the Fingers, or thoſe places that are about the Hand Wriſt, as alſo the Joynts of the Arm and Elbow, and ſomtimes likewiſe the Neck, and the Joynts of the Jaw-bone. And indeed this Evil in the firſt beginning of it (for the moſt part) ſeizeth upon but one of the Joynts, either in the Foot, (which moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally happeneth) or elſe where; but then afterwards, (the bowels being debilitated by the thick and often returns of the Diſeaſe, and the Native heat being much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and the matter dayly more and more heaped up) it then invadeth more of the Joynts; ſo that it often cometh to that paſs, that there is ſcarcely any Joynt or Juncture of the bones throughout the whole Body that may be ſaid to be free from this Malady; and as <hi>Lucian</hi> (in his <hi>Tragopodagra</hi>) writeth, <hi>This Evil tortureth and tormenteth the afflicted and Miſer able Body, from the very Fingers ends, even unto the extream parts of the Feet, and the ends of the Toes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and oftentimes it comes to that, that the vitious Humor is not only poured out into all the Joynts, but likewiſe into other ſenſible parts; as it hath been often obſerved, that in ſome this Humor hath been ſo poured forth into the Teeth, that it hath there cauſed a pain; and in others (in whom it hath been poured forth unto the breaſt) it hath there excited a ſpurious and baſtard Pleuriſie.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37365:42"/>
               <p>But now this Malady is not wont to continue long at a time, but to afflict the party by certain intervals and Periods, whiles the matter heaped up is thruſt forth unto the Joynts by certain intervals; which indeed in the beginning are ſomwhat longer; ſo that the Diſeaſed perſons are often free for ſix months, and ſomtimes likewiſe they are free from this Gout for a whole year together; but then afterwards the Bowels and the Native heat being much weakned and impayred, and many vitious Humors being heaped up together, the Malady returneth by ſhorter intervals,
<note place="margin">The period of the gout</note> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after three months, and ſomtimes every month; Yea and ſome there are, whom it doth continually afflict and make them to keep their beds.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Arthritis,</hi> or the Gout, is in the general defined to be,
<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Gout in general.</note> 
                  <hi>A pain of the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Joynts, excited from the defluxion of a ſerous and ſharp Humor, and poured forth into them out of the Veins and Arteries.</hi> Or, if it pleaſe you rather to define it in any other manner, when a ſwelling doth now concur with it, you may then ſay that it is a <hi>Tumor or Swilling about the Joynts, ariſing from a defluxion of the ſerous or whey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and ſharp Humor by the Veins and Arteries unto the place affected; and by reaſon of the extenſion of the Membranes about the Joynts, and the Acrimony of the Humors Twinging and pulling them it hath Joyned with it a pain, and hinderance of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe that the Nature of this Diſeaſe is ſuch,
<note place="margin">Whether it be proper to the gout to return by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</note> that when it hath once begun to infeſt and trouble a perſon, the Body can hardly ever be ſo carefully looked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and well ordered, but that upon every ſleight cauſe and upon the leaſt occaſion given it will again return, and indeed by certain Periods, (ſomtimes once a year, ſomtimes every ſix Months, and now and then once every Month:) many therefore of the moſt learned Phyſitians do likewiſe add this in the definition, that it is a pain or ſwelling returning by certain intervals and Periods. But if there be any one that thinketh it therefore to be omitted, becauſe that he who is at the firſt troubled with the Gout, and ſo hath not ſuffered many Paroxyſms returning by intervals, yet may be truly ſaid to be affected with the Gout: yet Notwithſtanding, he cannot deny this, that the very Nature of the Diſeaſe is ſuch that even in the very firſt Paroxyſm the Diſeaſe is in it ſelf naturally fit to return by intervals; like as he who is at firſt taken with a Tertian or Quartane Feaver, is truly ſaid to be troubled with a Tertian or a Quartan, albeit that he hath not yet undergone many Paroxyſms or ſits retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning every Third or Fourth day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franciſcus India</hi> indeed blameth thoſe that define the Gour by a pain, in regard that neglecting the Diſeaſe they define this Malady by its Symptoms. But it is no new thing, to define ſome certain Affects (in the which the Symptom and the Diſeaſe concur) by the Symptoms, as more urgent, more troubleſom and grievous unto the Diſeaſed party, and more manifeſt in themſelves. And ſo the Phrenſy is defined by a Deliry, and the Pleurifie by a pain; although that there be in both places preſent a Diſeaſe, to wit, an inflammation. And therefore there are many of the ableſt Phyſitians, both Ancient and Modern, who inſcribe their Tracts touching this Affect, <hi>of the pain of the Joynts.</hi> Neither again may be Gout be here alwaies ſo fitly defined by a Tumor or ſwelling, in regard that oftentimes there is no ſwelling evidently appearing in the External parts; and yet nevertheleſs the pain is then greater and more vehement then when there is a ſwelling in the part. But <hi>India</hi> himſelf is very much miſtaken and greatly erreth, whiles he defineth this Malady by a deflux.</p>
               <p>And moreover,
<note place="margin">Whether every pain of the joynts ought to be called the Gout?</note> although that every Gout that happeneth about the Joynts may be called a pain (and in this manner this name may be alſo attributed unto pains that happen in disjoyntings, Contuſions, or bruiſes and blows, wounds, that which is in the French Pox, that which happeneth unto Virgins while their Courſes are flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing from them, or ſuch as happen unto the Hips of great Bellyed Women that are neer the time of their Travail, or in general, unto all pains whatſoever that happen about the Joynts:) yet notwithſtanding, we do not here take the word Gout in ſo large a ſence, but in a more eminent and eſpecial manner we here by this Name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that peculiar kinde of pain which the Germans cal <hi>Das Zipperlein,</hi> ariſing from a ſudden influx of a Humor into the Joynts, inſinuating it ſelf into the more hidden and inward parts of the Joynts, and returning by intervals and Periods.</p>

               <p>The ſubject of the Gout (if it be defined by pain) are only the Membranous parts,
<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Gout.</note> and thoſe parts about the Joynts that are endued with a quick ſenſe and feeling. For a Membrane being the Adequate ſubject of the Touch, even here alſo thoſe parts that are grieved with pain do ſuffer it as they are membranous;
<note place="margin">Whether al the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments want ſenſe</note> from which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we may not exclude the Membranous Ligaments. For although that <hi>Galen</hi> teach us that all the Ligaments want ſenſe, yet notwithſtanding we are not to deny ſenſe unto the Membranous Ligaments, which (as we finde by experience) are very ſenſible of pricking, and the Gout it ſelf doth evidence it. Neither is that Reaſon they commonly alleadg to the Contrary of any great weight and moment, to wit, that a Man ſhould be alwaies Obnoxious unto pains, and never free from excrucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Tortures, if the Ligaments that are ſenſible of pain ſhould daſh and ſtrike againſt the bones: for Nature hath ſo fenced and guarded thoſe parts, and ſo admirably ordered it, that no ſuch thing can happen. And hence it is that we daily lay hold on with our hands, and walk upon our Feet, in which there are very many Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, Nerves, and Membranes, and yet nevertheleſs we are not ſenſible of any pain. But if it be defined by a Tumor or ſwelling, then all the parts that joyn together the Joynt, and lie round about it, may be ſaid to be the ſubject of the Gout. But now that theſe pains are excited more about the Joynts, then elſewhere, the Cauſe is this, to wit, that the Veins and Arteries pour forth in theſe places (in the which there is a Concourſe of the Membranes and Nerves) thoſe Sharp Humors which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture endeavoreth to expel, and which cannot flow forth in the middle Channel of the ſaid Veins and Arteries; and becauſe that the Humors arriving at the ſeat of the Joynts ſtick faſt in theſe more ſtreight and narrow places, where all the parts that end there are joyned together, and infolded the one within the other; whereas elſwhere they might more freely be moved up and down, and have room enough to diſperſe themſelves hither and thither.</p>
               <p>And indeed, the truth is, that now and then that Humor is alſo diffuſed into other parts; and there is a certain Nameleſs Author, who <hi>(in the eighth Section of his B. of the Gout, added unto the writings of the principal Phyſitians)</hi> telleth us, that theſe kind of fluxions do not only infeſt the Hands, Feet, and all the joynts, but that it likewiſe maketh an impreſſion upon the very Head, upon the very Liver, yea and ſomtimes upon the very Heart it ſelf. And <hi>Hieronymus Capivaccius</hi> alſo (in his <hi>Conſil.</hi> collected from <hi>Scholtzius, Conſil.</hi> 226.) maketh mention of the Gout pain in the ſide; by reaſon of which the ſick perſon was conſtrained to lie upon his Back, neither was he able to move his ſides. And a perſon of Honor once told me (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) that a certain man afflicted with the Gout, felt likewiſe very fore and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous pains in his very Yard: and it was related unto me by an Honorable Lady, that a Kinſwoman of hers being troubled with the Gout, a certain Marl (for ſo ſhe called it, and indeed not unfitly) brake forth alſo in her Fore-Head, ſo that it might have been even ſwept off like ſand, and grains of Salt. But the truth is, the Cauſe breeding the Gout, if it be in great abundance, it may likewiſe be diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into other parts beſides the joynts, but yet notwithſtanding it doth not breed the Gout any where elſe but in the joynts.</p>
               <p>But now it may here in this place (and that not without good cauſe) be demanded how it comes to paſs that thoſe perſons that are afflicted with the Gout do yet ſo ſeldom ſuffer any Convulſion (but only a pain) whenas yet the Nervous parts are here affected,
<note place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Why thoſe who are troubled with the Gout do ſeldom ſuffer any convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus.</p>
                  </note> and indeed ſo twinged and pulled by the ſharp Humor that there may ſeem to be great cauſe for the exciting of a Convulſion? <hi>Thomas Eraſtus,</hi> in his 4. <hi>Diſputat.</hi> againſt <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> thinks this to be the Cauſe, that the Humor that is poured forth about the Nerves is wateriſh and Flegmatick, and therefore doth more looſen then extend them: and if this be not the Cauſe, he confeſſeth ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly that he is altogether ignorant of it, and knoweth not what it is. But yet we do not acknowledg this for the only true Cauſe; neither is it indeed a truth that the Humor exciting the Gout is ſimply wateriſh and Flegmatick, that rather looſeneth then extendeth the parts, as we ſhall hereafter prove, and as it appeareth even by the pain it ſelf, which is moſt ſharp and intollerable. And therefore I conceive the cauſe hereof to be in the place affected, to wit, that not the very Nerves themſelves (as they are inſerted into the parts deſtined unto motion, <hi>v.z.</hi> The Muſcles that ſerve thereunto) are affected, but rather the Membranes, and the Membranous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, which parts are not ordained for motion, neither ſerve they thereunto;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37365:45"/>and therefore although they ſuffer moſt grievous pains, yet nevertheleſs they excite no Convulſive motion, unleſs haply the Brain be drawn into conſent; like as we may plainly ſee the truth of this in the pains of the Teeth, the Eyes, the <hi>Pleura</hi> Membrane, the <hi>Colon</hi> Inteſtine, and the like pains; in all which it is not the Nerves (appointed for motion) but rather the Membranes that are affected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any kind of Convulſion. And the very ſame happeneth in the Gout, in which the membranous parts that are about the Joynts, and knit together the extremities of the Joynts, are either diſtended, or twinged and pulled by the Humors flowing thereunto.</p>
               <p>There are ſome indeed who aſſert, that the very Cavity or hollow ſpace that is between the extremities of the Bones do receive the Humors that flow thereunto, and that this ſpace is the true ſubject of the Cauſe breeding the Gout. But this is falſe, as anon we ſhall ſhew you in the <hi>Third Queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Proxime</hi> or next Cauſe of the Gout pain (as in other parts likewiſe) is the ſolution of Continuity, which is produced by the afflux of the ſharp Humors into the Membranous parts about the Joynts either by diſtending them, or elſe by their acrimony at once both pricking and pulling them.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe things that accompany this pain, are Firſt, an impotency and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the motion;
<note place="margin">Symptoms of the gout</note> and by the motion of the joynt the pain is irritated and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And then alſo a ſwelling (and this for the moſt part with a redneſs and heat) followeth upon it, and is diſcerned more eſpecially in the extream joynts; and yet nevertheleſs, there appeareth now and then only a moiſt and wateriſh ſwelling without any redneſs at al. In the Hip and Shoulder blade (being fleſhy places) there ſcarcely appeareth any ſwelling at all externally, but the Humor that hath flown thereunto lieth hid and covered by the fleſh. And there is alſo a Feaver (a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued one) that almoſt alwaies with a pain invadeth in the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> or Gout in general, and oftentimes alſo in the Gout of the Feet and Knees; and the ſick perſon is firſt of all taken with an extream Chilneſs, and then preſently a heat followeth upon it; and this is the Cauſe that the ſick perſons are ſo vexed and troubled with thirſt, and that the pulſe is changed, and that the Urines become very red, which oftentimes at the firſt beginning are wateriſh. But now what kinde of Feaver this is that accompanieth the Gout, in this many Authors differ, as below, in the <hi>fourth Queſtion,</hi> we ſhall ſhew you. And ſomtimes there are likewiſe other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that follow upon the ſaid pain; and among the reſt, watchings, reſtleſſneſs, and a <hi>Spaſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Gout continue long, and often afflict the ſick party, then at the length there are generated in the joynts hard knots and knobs, from the more thick part of the ſerous or wheyiſh Humor, that even of its own accord tendeth to a Coagulation or Clotting together; and if the Skin be opened, out there runneth a matter, ſomtimes fluid and white, and ſomtimes like unto Playſter or white Lime; and ſomtimes the matter is hard, like unto gravelly ſtones that may be crumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>This Malady is likewiſe known to diſperſe it ſelf among the common People, the Cauſe being Generated from the general and common fault and vice either of the Air, or of the ordinary diet in many places.

               <p>THe <hi>Proxime</hi> or nigheſt Cauſe of this pain in the Gout, is the Solution of Unity in the Membranous parts about the joynts:
<note place="margin">The cauſe of the gout. Solution of Unity in the Gout from whence it happeneth</note> Now this ſolution proceedeth not (as <hi>Capivaccius</hi> wil have it) only from a Compreſſion of the ſenſible parts about the joynt, cauſed by a preternatural repletion of the Ligaments with a Humor flowing thereto. For why, the Ligaments are moſt ſolid, and moſt thick, in ſo much that (in the firſt place) they themſelves cannot admit of the Humors; and the pain is oftentimes in the higheſt degree, (when there is ſcarcely any ſwelling appearing,) and indeed far greater then that it ſhould poſſibly be cauſed by compreſſion only. This pain is therefore rather cauſed by the diſtention, and twinging, or pricking, in the ſenſible and tender parts about the Joynt.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:37365:46"/>
               <p>But now, what the Cauſe of this diſtention, Pulling, and Pricking, is, cannot eaſily be explained, by reaſon of the difference in Opinions (among Phyſitians,) touching the ſame. For ſome there are that teach us how that the Gout is generated only from a diſtemper; others from a Winde; a third ſort, only from a Humor; and ſome of theſe will have this Humor to be flegm, others Choler, others Flegm with Choler; others aſſert it to be Flegm mingled with blood; others, Crude and Watery blood; others ſay that it is a whey; and others there are that admit of all theſe Humors. And indeed ſome affirm that this Humor floweth down from the Head, others again from the internal parts; others from the external parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Skul and the Skin; ſome again wil have it to flow forth of the Veins, and others by both theſe waies; touching which we intend to diſcourſe more at large, below, in the <hi>ſeventh Queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in brief,
<note place="margin">The neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cauſes of the gout</note> that we may here in a word ſtate the Controverſie, the immediate and neereſt Cauſe of the Gout is a Humor, partly diſtending the parts of a quick ſenſe about the joynt, and partly pricking and lancing them, to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſerous or wheyiſh Humor, and yet ſuch as is not wateriſh, but Salt and ſharp, and (as the Chymiſts call it) Tartarous; bred in the ſanguification, in the Liver, and in the Spleen, and by Nature thruſt forth by the Veins and Arteries into the parts about the joynt. And indeed this Humor is altogether of a peculiar Nature, and much different from theſe other Humors that breed an inflammation in other parts; and it hath its original from the ſame kind of Aliment that Plants draw from the Earth. For in all ſorts of Earth there is ſomthing that is ſaltiſh, and partaking of a Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nature. Which whether we call it the Salt of the Earth, or elſe Tartar (with the common ſort of Chymiſts) it matters not with me, ſo that we agree in the thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding it ſeems not al one to me,
<note place="margin">Whether the Salt of the Earth and Cartar differ.</note> whether we call it the Salt of the Earth, or elſe Tartar. For Salt is indeed a ſimple Body of its own kind; but Tartar (as it is in truth taken here generally in this place by the Chymiſts) is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of Salt, and Earth, yea and of Sulphur likewiſe. From whence alſo it is that there are conſtituted Differences of ſuch like Earths; and ſo there ariſeth a diverſity of the Humor breeding the Gout in divers Bodies and places. And from either the abundance or ſcarcity of this Salt, and the mixture of it with other Juyces there ariſe various differences of Earths; ſo that ſome of them are dirty, others muddy, a third ſort Clayiſh, a fourth ſandy and Crumbling, a fifth Limye; and in ſome Earths there is an abundance of that we call Marle, in others Chalk, and in others there is ſomthing elſe that aboundeth: and in ſome Earths (in the which likewiſe Bread Corn grows very plentifully) there is ſo great a ſtore of this Salt, that even out of them there may be deſtilled a certain ſpirit that diſſolveth Metals. That Salt or Tartar is attracted from Plants (together with their Aliment) out of the Earth; and hence it is derived into men unto whom thoſe Plants ſerve for Meat and Drink: and unleſs it be ſevered and ſeparated in a Convenient manner, it is at length mingled together with the blood, and being altogether unfit for the nouriſhing of the Body it is in the end driven down and thruſt into the joynts, for thoſe Cauſes that we ſhal anon declare unto you. And this Salt Humor that cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Gout oftentimes cometh very neer unto the Nature of ſpirits (as the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts call them) ſuch as are thoſe of Wine, and other Vegetables, endued with a volatile Salt; as alſo of Salt, Vitriol, Nitre, and <hi>Aqua Fortis;</hi> which although that they are thin, Subtile, and Reſemble the Nature of Water, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they contain in them a moſt ſharp and biting Salt. And this Salt is contained as well in the Arteries, as in the Veins; from whence likewiſe it is, that being moſt ſubtile it exciteth very extream, intollerable, and moſt acute pains. For it is not requiſite, that thoſe Humors ſhould alwaies hurt the Body in a thick and groſs manner; but oftentimes they are made ſpiritual, as we ſhal afterwards alſo (in the Cauſes) ſhew you, touching Wine. And many things there are that teach us the truth of this. Firſt of all the very vehemency and fiercenſs of the pain it ſelf, which cannot poſſibly proceed from a Flegmatick or watry Humor, or elſe from Blood diſtending the parts; but from a very ſharp Humor, being oftentimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but little in its quantity and bulk, but yet in power very great, and moſt effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious. And moreover it appeareth from this, that at length there are generated in the Joynts certain hard knobs and knots; out of which there is taken, and goeth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37365:46"/>forth a matter like unto Lime, ſuch as alſo ſome certain Wines before they be wrackt and taken off their Lees do yield forth; which happeneth not at all in other Tumors, which are rather turned into <hi>Pus,</hi> then any ſuch matter as this; and therefore it ſufficiently ſheweth that the Gout hath ſome other peculiar cauſe, that the reſt of the Tumors or ſwellings have not. And Thirdly, the Cauſes do argue and prove the ſame; ſince that there is nothing that maketh more for the generation of the Gout then Wine, which moſt of all aboundeth with ſuch a Salt and Tartar as we mentioned before; there being no plant (as we ſhall alſo further ſhew you below) that doth more attract that that is Salt, Clayie, and Limye, in the Earth, then the Vine it ſelf; although indeed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plants likewiſe, (as Wheat and Barley) do draw unto them the very ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as the Vine doth, but in nothing neer ſo great an abundance. Yea, and this matter is ſomtimes likewiſe contemed in the Water; and from hence it is, that now and then ſuch as are Abſtemious, or that otherwiſe by reaſon of their poverty they drink no Wine, but Water, are yet troubled with the Gout; and in ſome places we find that even Beer is exceeding hurtful unto thoſe that are ſubject unto the Gout, whether this happen by Reaſon of the Corn there growing (of which they make their Beer) or from the Water they uſe for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And from hence it cometh to paſs, that the Gout in very many places is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe almoſt Epidemical. And in thoſe very places where the Gout is in a manner Epidemical (as it is in many places of <hi>Moravia</hi>) the inhabitants there, beſides the Gout, are troub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed likewiſe with the Stone, Colick, and that which ariſeth from thence, the Pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> and contraction of the Members, and likewiſe the Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which affects (all or moſt of them) proceed not from the Watery Humor, but alſo from that which is ſharp and Salt. And laſt of all, even this teacheth us that this Humor is ſerous or wheyiſh, that the Gout can by no means be drawn to a ſuppuration. For the blood is eaſily turned into <hi>Pus,</hi> and ſo are likewiſe the other Humors; but as for the ſerous and Salt Humors, this is the Nature of them, that if they be altogether thin, they are then wholly reſolved; or if they have any thing that is Tartarous and thick mingled with them, they are then converted into hard knots, and ſmal Stones that are brittle and crumbling.</p>
               <p>This matter, in regard that it cometh neerer unto the Nature of Minerals then of vegetables, it cannot therefore by any means afford a good and fit Aliment unto the Body; and ſo it ought either immediatly in the Firſt, or elſe in the Second Concoction to be exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lled; which when it happeneth, the Gout is not then gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. And from hence it is, that many Wine-bibbers, and Gluttons, are free from the Gout; which therefore happeneth, becauſe that they have thoſe their Bowels that are deſtined for Concoction very ſtrong and vigorous; ſo that they do exactly ſeparate all whatſoever is Excrementitious in thoſe Meats and Drinks that they take in, and evacuate them by convenient waies. But if this matter be not forthwith evacuated, but be reteined ſtil in the Body, it is then thruſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hither and thither in the Body, until it be at the length driven unto the Joynts.</p>
               <p>And therefore without cauſe or ground it is (as anon in the 5.
<note place="margin">Whether Choller, Flegm, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For poſſibly it may be that in one Body this Humor may abound and in another that Humor may be in great abundance, and may together flow unto the pained Joynt: yet nevertheleſs, that wheyiſh Humor (which Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to expel forth and therefore thruſts it forward unto the Joyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s) is the firſt Cauſe of the motion; and then afterwards the pain likewiſe ſtirs up and cauſeth other humors to flow unto the place affected: and therefore if the Body be Pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, the blood; but if Cacochymical, then other Humors alſo are moved unto the place affected. Mean while, thoſe very Humors are not the prime cauſe of the Gout; and if they had been altogether without that ſalt and ſerous Humor, it had never flown unto the joynts, ſince that there are many that are Plethorick and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymick, who yet notwithſtanding are not troubled with the Gout. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what <hi>Mercatus</hi> writeth, is a truth, to wit, that although juyces or Humors may much abound in the Body, and become very vitious, they do not for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently degenerate into the Articular affects, and produce the Gout: but that Humor which ought to produce the Gout (as we have already ſaid) is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37365:47"/>ſerous, Salt, Sharp, and Tartarous; and hath a peculiar tendency unto the joynts.</p>
               <p>And now,
<note place="margin">What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every fluxion.</note> whereas unto every fluxion there is required the matter flowing, the Term from which, and the place whitherto it tendeth, and the way by which; and that we have now already ſpoken unto the matter, the cauſe of the Gout; it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that we proceed to ſpeak of the Term from whence, (or the place in which the matter is generated) the way by which it floweth, and the term unto which it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, or the part receiving.</p>
               <p>And that we may firſt of all Treat of the part receiving, (that ſo we may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Joyntly explain the Cauſes both internal and external: in the firſt place, the parts recipient are here the Joynts, (and thoſe of the Feet eſpecially, from which the Gout <hi>Podagra</hi> hath its original) as weaker then al the reſt of the parts, in regard that they are endued with a weaker heat, conſiſting (as they do) of bones, liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<note place="margin">The part receiving the fluxion in the gout</note> Cartilages, Tendons, Nerves and Membrans; and are further diſtant from the Fountain of heat; and are likewiſe greatly expoſed unto the injuries of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſes; and are alſo much weakned by labor and frequent exerciſes, and hereupon are rendered moſt apt and ready to receive the Humors that flow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
<note place="margin">The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the joynts how is concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the Gout.</note> And yet notwithſtanding the alone imbecillity of the joynts is not ſufficient for the generating of the Gout, but there is likewiſe altogether neceſſary the fluxion it ſelf.</p>
               <p>For (as <hi>Galen</hi> hath it in his <hi>Sixth B. of the preſervation of Health Chap.</hi> 13.) they who Collect and Treaſure up nothing within them that is ſuperfluous, in them theſe weak and infirm parts remain ſtil in ſafety. Of which this is one moſt evident Argument, that ſome have for many Months together been very weak and infirm in divers parts of their Body, without any ſuch pain as the Gout bringeth along with it; whereas if weakneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone would cauſe it, the infirm part ſhould perpetually be troubled, there being no Ceſſation at all of the Cauſe of its weakneſs and infirmity. And now therefore, becauſe that it is not perpetually afflicted, (the Cauſe of its imbecillity being ſtill continued) we may conclude, as a thing moſt manifeſt, that there is ſomething elſe intervening, which is the Cauſe of the breeding of this affect; and this moſt certainly is nothing elſe, but that that is redundant either in quality or quantity. And yet notwithſtanding, that the imbecillity of the parts is the neceſſary cauſe of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating of the Gout, (as the moſt of the ableſt Phyſitians do aſſert and determine) is denied by <hi>Carolus Piſo</hi> (in his <hi>B. touching Diſeaſes from the affluence of the ſerous Humor, Conſil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. of the Gout</hi>) whileſt he writeth, that Phyſitians oftentimes trouble themſelves to no purpoſe, when they admoniſh us, that there is a very ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard to be had unto the weakneſs of the recipient parts, ſeeing that the Joynts do more eaſily and readily of their own accord receive and admit the hot Wheyiſh Humor, then the reſt of the Members; this doth not (ſaith he) proceed from their imbecillity, or from any diſtemper, that is, looſneſs, or rarity, but from the very Conformation it ſelf, and this not placed in the Cavity, but rather in the Conjunction with the ends of all the Veſſels; which Conformation to alter and change is not at all within our power. And he hath there aſſerted, that the Joynts for this Reaſon only admit of and drink in the hot Wheyiſh Humor, becauſe that in them are terminated the external branches of the internal Veſſels. To wit, that the Ebullition or boyling out of this ſerous Humor doth firſt of all begin in the greater and the internal Veſſels, and that from hence it falleth forth into the leſſer, and at length into the extream branches, which having no other place whither they they may pour back the Humor they have received in, it is thereupon ſtopt and heaped up together in the joynts, in which the external Veſſels (almoſt al of them) are terminated. All which although it may ſeem very agreeable unto the truth, yet notwithſtanding two things there are that muſt here be taken notice of. The former is this, that although it be true, that thoſe greater Trunks of the hollow Vein, and the Arteries, (their branches being diſperſed hither and thither) are for the greateſt part of them terminated in the joynts: yet Nevertheleſs there are likewiſe many of thoſe branches which here and there are Terminated in the Fleſh, and other parts, and yet for all that they Transfuſe not the matter of the Gout into thoſe parts. And moreover alſo the matter of the Gout is not alwaies poured forth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37365:47"/>even unto the extream Joynts, but that it oftentimes alſo ſtops and ſtaies in the mid-way, in the Hip, Knees, and Elbows. The other thing to be taken notice of, is this, that albeit that Conformation of the Veſſels (by reaſon of which they are terminated into the Joynts) cannot be changed; yet notwithſtanding the Laxity and weakneſs of the parts into which they are ingrafted may in ſome meaſure be changed by thoſe medicaments that cotroborate, although it be the leaſt part of the Cure (as hath been ſaid) that is to be expected from theſe.</p>
               <p>But beſides the imbecillity of the Joynts,
<note place="margin">Why the humor that is the cauſe of the gout is moved unto the Joynts ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to the other parts.</note> there is yet ſomething elſe that ſeemeth to me to be the Cauſe why this humor is moved unto the Joynts rather than to any other parts; which conceit of mine I ſubmit (as a Paradox only) and leave it unto the free judgment of the Judicious and Candid Reader; and it is this. It is moſt certain, that the Blood in our Bodies is not altogether homogeneous, but obtaineth divers parts, and that divers parts of the Body are nouriſhed by thoſe different parts of the Blood; as the Fleſh by the more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, the Bones by the thicker, the Lungs by the more ſubtile, and ſo likewiſe the reſt of the parts attract unto themſelves from the blood a fit and convenient Nutriment. And this ſeemeth alſo to be proved by the ſtone called <hi>Oſteocolla</hi> (ſo called becauſe that it hath in it a notable virtue of Conglutinating the broken Bones) which being taken inwardly penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into the Bones, rather than into any other parts, and cauſeth that the <hi>Calli</hi> are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a very ſhort time; yea, in thoſe that are yong it produceth an overgreat <hi>Callus;</hi> as we may ſee in <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> his firſt Century, <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 90. <hi>&amp;</hi> 91. Neither are theſe things done in a ſound Body only; but even the vitious humors likewiſe have not an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation al of them, neither are they al driven unto any one part; but ſome of them tend unto one part, and others of them unto other parts; and this we are taught, as by other diſeaſes, ſo more eſpecially by the <hi>Plica Polonica</hi> above mentioned. And therefore ſeeing that <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules Saxonia</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Plica,</hi> Chap. 26. writeth nothing but the truth, when he ſaith that the humor (the Cauſe of the <hi>Plica</hi>) hath a propriety not wel agreeing with the Joynts, Ligaments, Tendons, Nerves, and al the Membranes; but a certain familiarity with the Hairs and the extream part of the skin: I conceive that I may alſo as rightly Aſſert that the Humor the Cauſe of the Gout hath a certain kind of familiarity and natural alliance with the Bones; but that it is an Enemy unto the Membranous parts, if not in an occult manner, yet certainly by its Acrimony, and by its twinging and lancing faculty. For very probable it is, ſeeing that the Bones as alſo the Ligaments and tendons, are nouriſhed by a Blood that is more Earthy, as having an alliance with the Tartarous humor; that other Tartarous humors alſo (as wel the thick, as the ſubtile) are thruſt forth more unto the Joynts than unto any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts; and more eſpecially unto the Joynts of extream parts, ſince that Nature (as much as poſſibly ſhe can) is wont to thruſt forth the vitious humors from the principal places unto the moſt remore parts. For although it be ſo ſomtimes that Nature doth not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thruſt forth into the extream Joynts of the Feet or the Hands the matter that is the Cauſe of the Gout, but that it ſtops and ſtaies in the mid'ſt of ſome Joynt; yet notwithſtanding afterwards when the pains begin Nature (if ſhe be yet any thing ſtrong) driveth back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the greater Veins the Matter by the ſame waies by which it flowed in; and from hence ſhe thruſts it forward even unto the extream Joynts: touching which, as alſo whether there lie any thing hid in the very Bones themſelves that may make for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing of the Arthritick Paroxyſm, we ſhal ſpeak more hereafter in the eighth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Whether the Gout be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a collection of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</note> As touching theſe humors (that are the Cauſe of the Gout) where they are Generated, and by what waies they paſs into the Joynts, the Opinions of Phyſitians are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and different; of which we ſhal ſpeak further in the ſeventh Queſtion. But now that I may in few words comprize the ſum and ſubſtance of the thing in queſtion; ſeeing that al ſwellings, and the preternatural Collection of humors in any part, is done two waies; to wit, either by Congeſtion by which the humor is by little and little collected and heaped up in the part, or elſe by Afflux; we cannot conceive that the former of theſe waies hath any place in the Gout. For if by Congeſtion and the alone weakneſs of the parts the humor ſhould be collected in the Joynts, then the pain and ſwelling could not be bred ſo ſuddenly, ſo eaſily, and ſo evidently; and the infirm part ſhould perpetually labor and ſuffer, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the Cauſe of this diſtemper and pain ſhould never be abſent from it. But now, ſince that Perſons that have the Gout are not in a continual ſuffering condition, but that ſome of them are free for ſix months together, and that afterward the matter again floweth unto the Joynts, and that indeed ſuddenly, to wit, when there is a vitious humor collected in the Body, which urgeth and provoketh Nature unto the expulſion thereof: it eaſily from hence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37365:48"/>appeareth that the Gout is not generated by the collection of humors, that is not done but by degrees, now a little, and then a little. And therefore the moſt learned <hi>Solenander</hi> writeth truly in his <hi>fourth Sect. Conſil.</hi> 24 <hi>The humor</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which is by little and little collected by the vice and fault of the particle of Nouriſhing, if at any time it could excite pain, and hinder the Motion,
<note place="margin">The long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Gout from whence it is.</note> yet notwithſtanding there was never yet any Phyſitian that ever told us that it could excite the Diſeaſe we call the Gout.</hi> But this notwithſtanding in the mean time I deny not, that in thoſe who are ſcarcely ever wel in their Feet or other Joynts, the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity and weakneſs of the Joynts may poſſibly conduce very much unto the long laſting and continuation of the Malady. For the part that is infirm and weak doth not rightly aſſimilate the Aliment unto it ſelf, but collecteth the excrements, and thereupon it likewiſe the more eaſily receiveth the humors flowing unto it, and the more difficultly ſcattereth them when they are gotten together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Felix Platerus</hi> indeed maketh mention of a certain peculiar kind of Gout;
<note place="margin">Peculiar kinds of the Gout.</note> ſuch almoſt as we ſhal likewiſe make mention of a little below (in the <hi>Sixth Queſtion</hi>) out of <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> which is excited, not by the matter that floweth from elſewhere, but from the excrement that is heaped up together from the Blood about the Region of the Joynts, the place affected being extreamly weakned from the many fluxions, and there heaping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether new excrements, and cauſing a pain that is not very grievous or intollerable, which produceth a moiſt and watry kind of ſwelling rather than any other; and he aſſerts it for a moſt certain truth, that thoſe who are thus affected are very ſeldom or never free from the Gout; and ſomtimes by reaſon of the affluence of the humor, and ſomtimes again by the congeſtion and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing of it up; from the one or the other of theſe Cauſes they alwaies carry about with them certain ſigns and tokens of the ſame, and are continually ſuffering ſomthing or other by reaſon of it.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, this is no peculiar kind of the Gout; and if ſo be that it differ from the Gout which we have deſcribed, it is not then the Gout, but rather a moiſt and watry ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Feet. And hence it is that <hi>Platerus</hi> himſelf confeſſeth that it very ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver firſt beginneth of it ſelf, but that it is wont to follow ſome other that was cauſed from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion. To wit, by pain, and the long continued and frequent afflux of the humors the Joynts are ſo weakned, that they cannot rightly concoct the Aliment that floweth unto them; much leſs aſſimilate the ſame unto themſelves; and hence it is that there are many Excrements collected; and theſe being heaped up do excite that moiſt and watry ſwelling without any grievous pain: which ſwelling notwithſtanding (if the pain proper unto the Gout be not preſent with it) is not properly the Gout. But if the true <hi>Arthritis</hi> or Gout be joyned together with it, the debilitated part cannot then without much difficulty, and long time, diſcuſs and ſcatter the humor that hath flown unto it; and hereupon it hapenneth that before one humor be diſperſed (which as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writeth, is ſeldom or never before the fortieth day) another humor floweth unto it, and ſo the ſick Perſon may ſeem continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it were to be afflicted with the Gout; or likewiſe, if the Afflux be but by ſhort inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, he is in very deed perpetually troubled therewith.</p>
               <p>But now,
<note place="margin">From whence the Afflux pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth.</note> in what manner, and from whence this afflux proceedeth, here likewiſe Authors ſeem to differ much among themſelves. But if waving and laying aſide Authority, we heedfully attend and obſerve the thing it ſelf, and thoſe things that are done about the ſick perſon, we ſhal eaſily perceive that this Afflux is by the Veins and Arteries. For in ſuch as are troubled with the Gout (upon the very firſt approach of the Paroxyſm) the Veſſels that tend unto the Hands and the Feet, and are inſerted into the extream Joynts, are wont manifeſtly to ſwel. And then again, this Diſeaſe doth ſuddenly invade, and the afflux is wont to be very ſudden, which cannot happen but only by the Veins and Arteries. And moreover,
<note place="margin">How and from whence the Afflux is in the Gout.</note> it eaſily paſſeth out of one place into another, eſpecially if cooling and repelling Medicaments be applied unto the part affected; and that pain that but even now afflicted the Foot, this Foot is no ſooner freed therefrom, but it preſently beginneth to afflict the other Foot, or the hand. Or, if Nature lie under the burden, and be not able to expel thoſe viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humors (theſe ſticking faſt about the Bowels, and eſpecially about the Heart) there are then excited ſtreightnings of the Heart, and faintings, with ſwounding fits (as I have oftentimes obſerved) which ceaſe not until that the vitious Humor be again driven out into another Joynt: which motion of the humor cannot be but by the common Veſſels. And furthermore, Feavers (as wel continual as intermitting) are ſomtimes terminated into the Gout; which could not be, unleſs the matter were in the Veins. And laſtly, a Feaver is wont to happen, and a change in the Pulſe, which ſheweth that the Humor is contained in the Veins and Arteries.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:37365:48"/>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing that this Humor (the cauſe of the Gout) is contained within the Veins and Arteries, and out of them poured forth into the Joynts;
<note place="margin">Where the Humor, the cauſe of the gout, is generated.</note> without doubt it muſt of neceſſity be generated in ſome Concoction of the Blood, and indeed ſuch a Concoction as out of which the Veins and Arteries receive that Humor which they contain: and this we determine to be in the Liver and Spleen, the Sanguification being there hurt in its own manner.</p>
               <p>But now, the Cauſes (by reaſon of which this humor is generated) are two:
<note place="margin">For what cauſes it is generated.</note> The former whereof is ſomthing amiſs in the Liver and Spleen, and more eſpecially the exceſſive heat and drineſs of thoſe parts; and then the other cauſe thereof (this being indeed the chief and principal) is ſuch a kind of Aliment from Meats and Drink as maketh a continual ſupply of ſuch a like Tartarous matter.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, The Stomach may indeed likewiſe confer ſomwhat hereunto, if in it the Chyle be not rightly elaborated; and if that after this Concoction the Tartarous feces or dregs be not moſt of them inſtantly ſeparated: and hence it is alſo that al Phyſitians warn us in the preventing of the Gout, to have a ſpecial regard unto the firſt Concoction: and yet notwithſtanding that hurt Concoction of the ſtomach doth not moſt immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce unto the generating of the Gout, but that there is a neceſſity that the Concoction in the Liver and Spleen ſhould likewiſe be hurt. For if there be any thing amiſs in theſe (which cannot indeed very eaſily and determinately be demonſtrated and made to appear) it then cometh to paſs that the unuſeful parts, ſalt and tartarous (which are in the Chyle) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rightly ſeparated, but remain mingled with the blood, and together with it are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto the Veins. And by reaſon of this Vice and fault of theſe Bowels it happeneth that oftentimes from Meats and Drinks in themſelves not very hurtful ſome perſons are very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily offended; and on the contrary, others that have ſtrong Bowels (in whom the Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the blood, and the ſeparation of the excrements is rightly performed) although they uſually feed upon meats apt to breed the Gout, and fil themſelves alſo with Wine (and that likewiſe none of the wholſomeſt) they are not yet for al this at al troubled with the Gout.</p>
               <p>But what this diſtemper of the Liver and Spleen is,
<note place="margin">What kind of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for the gout.</note> cannot ſo eaſily be explained and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded. And yet nevertheleſs, if any one ſhal determine it to be a hot and dry diſtemper, I ſhal not at al gain-ſay him. But in what manner this hot and dry diſtemper doth effect what hath been ſaid, this is not ſo clear. <hi>Franciſcus Valleſius</hi> tels us for a truth, That by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper there is ſtrongly preſſed forth a water from the reſt of the Juyces; which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, unleſs it be fitly explained. For this we willingly grant, That if the Liver be more hot and dry than what naturally it ſhould be, inſtead then of a moderate Elixation or boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there wil be a certain Aſſation or roſting; and ſo the blood that is generated muſt needs be ſharp. Others affirm (and indeed not unfitly) that the Liver and Spleen when they are vehemently and intemperately hot, attract the ſerous and ſalt Juyce in the Food, which ought to have been ſeparated and evacuated in the firſt Concoction, and ſo it comes to be mingled together with the blood. Yea, and haply alſo in the diſtempered Liver it ſelf and Spleen the Blood is not wel elaborated; and ſomthing there is left remaining therein that ought by right to have been ſeparated, which being afterwards heaped up in the Veins is the cauſe of the Gout.</p>
               <p>And I am of Opinion that the very ſame happeneth in the Liver and Spleen, that happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the Reins. For many there are that eat Cheeſe and other meats that are very apt to breed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Stone, and yet notwithſtanding they do not generate the ſame; whereas others on the contrary, in whoſe Reins there is a ſandy, gravelly, and ſtony conſtitution (as <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> calleth it) or a power in the Reins of breeding the ſtone, theſe are eaſily offended by the meats aforeſaid. And I conceive that the caſe is the ſame in the Gout; and that there is a certain vitious conſtitution in the Bowels of thoſe that are troubled with the Gout; and I am of Opinion that this vitious Conſtitution is the efficient cauſe of that Salt, or Tartar, by reaſon of which that Humor which is the cauſe of the Gout is produced, which when it once cometh to abound, it is then afterwards thruſt forth unto the Joynts. And this vitious conſtitution is communicated unto ſome from their Parents; and by others it is contracted from the uſe of Meat and Drink of a like Nature, and likewiſe from the Errors they commit in the whol courſe of their Dyet.</p>
               <p>And moreover, Although the faculty of the Bowels be wel conſtituted; yet if the Meat and Drink abound with ſuch a like Tartarous matter, it cannot al of it be evacuated by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in regard that neither in the firſt Concoction, nor yet in the ſecond, it cannot be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it ought to be, but remains ſtil mingled with the Blood. But yet in the mean time
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37365:49"/>(as much as may be) it is altered by Nature, and by her ſpiritualized alſo (if I may ſo ſpeak) or as <hi>Mercatus</hi> ſpeaketh, it is attenuated, poured abroad, and changed into a thin, ſpiritful, and ſharp humor, which is afterwards by Nature thruſt unto the Joynts. For the Joynts (as I ſaid before) are parts that are weak, and extream, bony, and bloodleſs, unto which Nature is wont to thruſt not only the ſerous Humors, but whatſoever likewiſe hath any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance at al with the Humor that floweth. But now the imbecility of the Joynts is either Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or acquired.
<note place="margin">The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Joynts twofold.</note> It may then be ſaid to be Native, when either the Joynts themſelves in their firſt ſtructure are more looſe, ſofter, and more apt to receive the Humors flowing unto them; or elſe when they have either from the Parents, or from the Grand Parents thus affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by a right of Inheritance (as it were) contracted this diſtemper and weakneſs. But it may then be ſaid to be acquired, when the Joynts are weakned either by overmuch labor, exceſs and injuries of the Air, or other Cauſes altering the Joynts.</p>
               <p>But now,
<note place="margin">Why the Humor is moved to the joynts.</note> that the Humor which is heaped up in the Veins, and about the Bowels, ſhould be moved unto the Joynts, this cometh to paſs, Becauſe that Nature being ſtirred up and forced by the abundance of vitious humors, attempteth the expulſion of them. And yet if any thing happen that may move the humors, the Paroxyſm is then more eaſily excited. And this cometh to paſs if any one be provoked to wrath, or ſtricken with terror, or any other vehement affect of the mind, or if any ſhal be very hor, and then ſuddenly cool again on one and the ſame day, or elſe ſhal exerciſe himſelf immoderately, or make uſe of the Bath unſeaſonably. And this is likewiſe done by the retention of the uſual and accuſtomed ſweat, or the exceſs in qualities of the Ambient Air, and the change thereof; and more eſpecially that change that is made at certain times of the Yeer: and it is manifeſt by Experience, that about the beginning of the Spring, and Autumn, the Blood is moved and ſtirred up and down in the Body; and if there be any thing faulty in it, Nature is wont to expel it unto the more ignoble parts; from whence ariſe ſcabbineſs, the <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> Feavers, Gouts, and many other Diſeaſes, according to the various diſpoſition of bodies.</p>
               <p>From al which it is eaſie to find out the Antecedent,
<note place="margin">The Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent cauſes.</note> Procatartick, and altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Cauſes, as alſo the external and internal Cauſes; which (of what kind ſoever they be) either they make for the generating of the matter and humor producing the Gout; or elſe they weaken the joynts; or elſe laſtly, they ſo cauſe it that the humors are moved and excited.</p>
               <p>But ſince that theſe are various, and that ſome of them do concur more waies for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of the Gout than others, they may therefore be conſidered according to thoſe things we cal Things not Natural.</p>
               <p>And firſt of al,
<note place="margin">Air.</note> As for the Air, We have already ſaid that in the Spring time the Gout is moſt chiefly excited; and then again in the Autumn, by reaſon of the motion and change of the Humors that happeneth at that time. And the truth is, the Gout is wont in the Spring time moſt eſpecially to infeſt the party, becauſe that the humors that have been al the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long heaping up, are wont then to be poured abroad, and moved up and down, as <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> telleth us in moſt elegant Verſes making a deſcription thereof, in his <hi>Tragopodagra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the very ſame may likewiſe be ſomtimes effected by other diſtempers of the Air: and like as the moiſt Conſtitution of the Air doth otherwiſe produce Catarrhs and Fluxes; ſo it likewiſe oftentimes cauſeth the Gout. And without doubt that Epidemical Gout (of which out of <hi>Athenaeus</hi> we ſhal anon in the fift Queſtion make mention) was at firſt produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſome peculiar Conſtitution of the Air.</p>
               <p>And moreover, the Courſe of Dyet that is obſerved doth make very much for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Gout; and eſpecially the drinking of ſtrong Wines, by which alone many have attracted the Gout unto themſelves; as <hi>Quintus Serenus</hi> writeth of <hi>Ennius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed there is no one thing that is more offenſive and hurtful unto perſons that are troubled with the Gout than the drinking of Wine, as we find it to be true by common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. For there is nothing that obtaineth more of that Tartarous matter (or call it what you pleaſe) that is ſo apt and fit to generate the Gout than Wine.</p>
               <p>Which matter although (as we ſaid a little before) it may in ſome ſtronger bodies be ſeparated; yet nevertheleſs, thoſe that find themſelves ſubject to the Gout, having but weak and infirm bowels, have no reaſon (after the example of other inſatiable Wine-drinkers) to indulge themſelves any liberty in the drinking of Wine; but it is far more fit for them to abſtain from it. And ſo on the contrary, many have been freed from the Gout by their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from Wine.
<note place="margin">The gout cured by abſtinence from Wine.</note> And <hi>Trincavel</hi> (in his twelfth Book, and ſecond Chapter, of the way of Curing the ſeveral parts of Mans Body) writeth that he knew a very aged Phyſitian at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> who having been exceedingly troubled with the Gout al his life long, even unto his old
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37365:49"/>Age, at length by abſtaining from Wine for five yeers only, he came to be ſo freed from all thoſe troubleſom and painful fits that attend the Gout, that he was ever after (even to the very laſt of his old Age, and to the hour of his death) altogether freed from theſe pains. And <hi>Franciſcus Alexander</hi> (in <hi>Deſcriptione Diacorallii</hi>) writeth likewiſe that one <hi>Francis Pechius,</hi> a man fifty yeers of age, and troubled with the Gout, was caſt into Priſon by a certain Marqueſs, and there kept twenty yeers; and that he was ever after this freed from the Gout. And <hi>Solenander</hi> alſo (in his 5. <hi>Sect. Conſil.</hi> 1.) relateth of a certain Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, a Spaniard both, that having omitted and left off the uſe of Wine (which yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhe had but very ſparingly made uſe of after the cuſtom of her Country, and alwaies diluting it with Water) ſhe was never more after that troubled with the Gout. And there are many other ſuch like known Hiſtories of them that have either been caſt into Priſon, or elſe have been reduced unto poverty, and ſo have of neceſſity abſtained from Wine, and thereby been freed from the Gout. To wit, whereas the next and moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Cauſe of the Gout (as we likewiſe told ye before) is ſome certain thing that hath as it were the Nature of a Mineral, and this altogether unfit for the nouriſhing of the body (ſuch like as is to be found in al kind of Earths, but yet in ſome more, in ſome leſs) the Vine attracteth it more powerfully than other Plants (and that this is ſo, appeareth even from that Tartar which is to be found more abundantly in the Vine than in any other Plant, and in that Vines wil grow and thrive in thoſe places wherein other Plants wil not proſper, as not having aliment enough; the Vines contenting themſelves in a manner only with that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſalt of the Earth) which afterward together with the Wine (although variouſly changed) is derived into Mans body, and being there heaped up it affordeth matter unto the Gout.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding there are likewiſe ſome kind of Meats and Drinks that make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much for the breeding of the Gout; and there are ſomtimes Waters to be found that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate the Gout; and in thoſe places where the Gout is Epidemical not only the rich that drink Wine, but the poor alſo that drink Water, are afflicted with the Gout. And ſo likewiſe <hi>Julius Alexandrinus</hi> writeth (in his fifteenth Book of things that are wholſom, and ſixt chapter) that he knew a certain perſon troubled with the Gout; in whom by the eating of Carps and Breams the Gout was perpetually bred. So that he could when he liſted by this means bring the Gout upon himſelf. And moreover,
<note place="margin">The gout cauſed by the eating of Carps. Wholſom Wines.</note> Wines they are not al of them of one and the ſame kind. For ſome of them proceed from a ſandy Earth, and contain leſs of this Tartarous matter. And ſuch are thoſe Wines that grow at <hi>Jaſſen</hi> (a Town hard by) called <hi>Gorubergenſian</hi> Wines; which although that they be drunk in great abundance by the Inhabitants of that place, yet I never heard of any of them that was there troubled with the Gout. And ſuch Wines as theſe are likewiſe to be found in many other places.
<note place="margin">Wines ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom.</note> But on the contrary, thoſe Wines that grow in an Earth that is fat, muddy, clayiſh, ſtony, and that hath in it a Mineral Marl, gravel, ſtones, or any thing elſe that is Mineral mingled with it, are very apt and ready to generate the Gout; and ſuch are the Wines of <hi>Moravia, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Hungary,</hi> and moſt of the Wines of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> And although that the Wines that do not generate the Gout leave oftentimes in the Veſſel more Tartar than thoſe Wines that do indeed produce the Gout; yea, and if they be diſtilled, there is likewiſe more of the ſaid Tartar found in them than there is in theſe (like as at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ratiſlavia</hi>) as that eminent and famous Phyſitian Doctor <hi>Doringius</hi> wrote unto me, of twenty four meaſures of Reniſh Wine there were found almoſt three ounces of Tartar; whereas in the diſtillation of as many Meaſures of the <hi>Tocavian</hi> Wine, that is accounted the ſtrongeſt of al the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Wines, there were ſcarcely two drams of Tartar to be found, yet nevertheleſs al this maketh nothing againſt what we have ſaid. For thoſe Wines have that Salt or Tartar ſuperficially only (as I may ſo ſay) and in a thick manner mingled together with them; or (that I may ſpeak with the Chymiſts) they have the Salt as yet fixed; but theſe have a volatile Salt or Tartar moſt exactly mingled with them, inſomuch that this Salt and Tartar is in a manner made ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; whereupon it is, that the former of theſe is more eaſily ſeparated either in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or in the Liver, and ſo is thruſt forth either by the belly with the reſt of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or elſe it is voided by Urine; but this other being mingled with the ſpirit of the Wine paſſeth into the very Maſs of the blood, and ſo penetrateth into the moſt inward parts of the body. And that thoſe Salts that were fixed may be made Volatile, the Diſtillations of Chymiſts do ſufficiently prove; and that the Tartar may be made as it were Spiritual, and elevated by the Alembick, this we are taught by the Tartarized Spirit of Wine: yea, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals may alſo be ſo diſſolved in ſtrong Waters and Spirits, that they may not only be ſtrained through paper, but that they may likewiſe be elevated into the Alem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ick: But yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37365:50"/>in regard that this Salt although it be ſubtile, is altogether unfit for the nouriſhing of the body, as partaking of a Mineral Nature (which is not fit for the nouriſhment of living Creatures) albeit it doth together with the blood penetrate into the Veins; yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as ſuperfluous and uſeleſs it is at length by Nature caſt forth of the Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and thruſt out unto the Joynts. And therefore, whether or no Wine be apt to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and cauſe the Gout, we are in the firſt place to judg of this by the place where it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and its effect; and then next of al by the ſtrength therof. For by how much the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Wines are, by ſo much the more exactly and ſubtilly is this Salt mingled with them, and becometh more ſpiritual: like as it appeareth in the Spirit of Wine that is Tartarizated, which is more ſtrong than the ſimple Spirit of Wine.</p>
               <p>All which notwithſtanding is thus to be taken, if by reaſon of the diſtemper and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Bowels (as we alſo ſaid before) that which in the Wine is Excrementitious and Tartarous, may not be ſeparated. For if it may be ſeparated, the Wine wil then be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and without any hurt in it. Yea, and if any ſuch Wine could be had that having but little of ſuch a like Tartarous matter in it ſhould yet ſtrengthen the weak Bowels that do not wel ſeparate theſe Excrements, and ſo ſhal help the Concoction and promote the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and evacuation of the Excrements, we grant that this would prove to be not only harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but likewiſe very uſeful and profitable if moderately drunk. And ſome tel us that the <hi>Pucine</hi> Wine is ſuch, and therefore they commend it for the prevention of the Gout. But I much doubt, whether this Wine be in al reſpects anſwerable unto what hath been ſaid; and therefore I conceive that it is good firſt to make trial, and to conſult with Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>We have indeed above ſpoken ſomthing as touching the cauſe for which certain Wines breed and cauſe the Gout:
<note place="margin">wine, how it doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate the gout.</note> but yet nevertheleſs, my deſire and purpoſe is here to explain the thing, and ſo to make the matter ſomwhat more cleerly to appear. I think it to be a very plain and cleer truth, that Wine produceth the Gout, not as it is Wine, but as it containeth in it ſomthing that is unfit, and ſomthing likewiſe that is extraneous, and unuſeful unto our bodies, which is therefore by Nature thruſt forth unto the Joynts. And this appeareth if by nothing elſe, yet by this, That there are ſome certain Wines that do not generate the Gout; and ſuch are our <hi>Gorubergenſian</hi> Wines, and many others alſo, that here in theſe Regions grow in Sandy places. For albeit theſe Wines be drunk for a dayly and ordinary drink, and that not ſcantly, but very plentifully; yet there was never any that from hence contracted the Gout. But on the contrary, the <hi>Moravian, Bohemian, Auſtrian, Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> and likewiſe very many more Wines of other Regions, are moſt apt to breed the Gout. Yea, and not only the Wines, but even the Waters of ſome places, dogenerate the Gout. And ſo it was related unto me by that eminent Phyſitian, <hi>Dn. D. Tobias Knoblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In certain places wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo generate the gout.</note> that at <hi>Iglavia</hi> in <hi>Moravia</hi> (where he had practiſed Phyſick there for ſome yeers) that not only the Wealthier ſort of People that drank Wine, but even the poor who hardly ever taſted a Cup of Wine, were al of them very ſubject unto the Gout, Colick, and Falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs, Diſeaſes Epidemical in that place.</p>
               <p>But now,
<note place="margin">What that is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that certain wines are apt to breed the gout.</note> Inquiry is to be made, What that ſhould be which maketh that certain Wines are apt to generate the Gout. Where we are firſt of al to take notice, that nothing doth nouriſh (touching which we have ſpoken elſwhere) but what proceedeth from things ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, or enlivened. And therefore al other things, as Minerals, Metals, and divers kinds of Earths, are unapt to nouriſh our bodies; and thereupon if they be at any time taken in, they are again to be evacuated either by the Urine, or elſe by the belly; and this if it be not done, they are then by Nature thruſt into the Joynts, and ſo they there generate the Gout. And therefore thoſe Vines that grow in a ſandy Earth, that is not at al fat and rank, have nothing that they may attract and draw unto them, beſides the Alimentary Juyce: but thoſe that grow in Clayiſh grounds, or any other fat Earths, do not attract unto themſelves only a vegetable juyce, but alſo a Mineral juyce as it were, and ſuch as is wholly unuſeful for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which is not unfitly termed Tartar, a ſubſtance, to wit, that conſiſteth of a fixed and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt, and of an Earthy and almoſt Mineral matter; ſuch as not only ſticketh faſt unto the ſides of Casks, but is likewiſe throughly mingled with the ſubſtance of the Wine. And this is altogether the Nature of Salts, that they reduce other bodies into the ſmalleſt Atomes, and then do aſſociate the Atomes unto themſelves. We may ſee an Experiment of this in the diſſolving of Metals in ſtrong Waters, in which the Metals (bodies otherwiſe thick) are ſo united unto the ſalt of the Waters that diſſolve them, that they may paſs through a Card or Paper. And the very ſame we likewiſe ſee in the diſſolving of Pearls, Margarites, Cerals, and Crabs Eyes, which ſticking faſt unto the Salt of the Vinegar, are throughly mingled
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37365:50"/>with the Water, and may be ſtrained through a Card; but being precipitated they will diſſolve no further. We have likewiſe an Example hereof in Vitriol, which being diſſolved in Water may likewiſe be ſtrained through a Card: but when the vitriol is Calcined, and the Salt drawn forth of it, there remaineth an Earth that is not diſſolveable by any liquor whatſoever. And ſo in hot Baths of Water there is an Earthy ſubſtance ſo exactly mingled therewithal, that it cannot poſſily be diſcovered by any ſenſe. But yet when this afterwards ſhall ſtick faſt unto the wooden and ſtony pipes, and ſhal ſubſiſt apart by it ſelf, it is not then any further to be diſſolved in Water. From all which it appeareth that the Gout is not gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated without Salt; and without doubt the ſharpeſt and moſt extream pains in the Gout are from Salt: but yet we ſay not that Salt alone, pure Salt doth this; ſince that there are Wines in many Regions that have Salt alſo, and yet for all that they do not generate the Gout; but there concurreth moreover a matter that is Clayiſh, Limy, Marly, or ſome Mineral which the Vine had attracted out of the ground, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the nouriſhment, concocted it, and mingled it with the Alimentary matter and ſo communicated it unto the Grapes; and hence the Wine alſo that is preſſed forth of the Graps receiveth and reteineth it. And hereupon it is that we ſee, how that in the Joynts of ſuch as are troubled with the Gout there are ſomtimes genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hard knobs and knots, and that there is as it were Lime taken forth of them; which indeed is nothing elſe but that ſame Mineral Matter which the Salt of the Wine drew along with it, and which at the length (as altogether unuſeful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the nouriſhment of the Body) is thruſt forth unto the Joynts. Now therefore (that we may come unto the Queſtion, why ſome Wines do generate the Gout, and others do not ſo) the more any Wine hath of this matter,
<note place="margin">what wines they are that do more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate the gout, and what, leſs.</note> and this throughly mingled with it by the ſmalleſt Atomes, by ſo much the more powerful it is for the generating of the Gout. Which cometh to paſs, in the firſt place, by Reaſon of the ſoyl, to wit, where the Wines grow, whether in a Muddy ground, or that that is Clayiſh, Limy, Marly, or any other Mineral Earth. And furthermore in the Second place, if the Wines ſhall not be wholly purifyed and freed from their Tartar, but ſtill remain as it were thick and turbid; and this happeneth firſt of al in Wines that are new, and not yet wrackt by turning them from Veſſel to Veſſel; and then Secondly in ſome certain Wines that wil never be altogether cleer; ſuch as are thoſe of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> &amp;c. And Thirdly, if that Tartarous matter be ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingled with the Wine in the ſmalleſt Atomes, that it cannot be ſeparated from our bodies, neither in the firſt, nor yet in the ſecond Concoction; which for the moſt part happeneth in Generous and ſtrong Wines, and ſuch as grow in places hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ordinary. For Wines that are not ſtrong and generous, although that even theſe may contain in them ſome of the ſaid Tartarous matter: yet notwithſtanding, in regard that the heat of the Country was not ſo powerful that it was able (either in the Vine, or in the Grapes,) to mingle this Tartarous matter with the Spirit that is in the Wine, it is thereupon alſo afterwards (either in the firſt, or in the ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction) more eaſily ſeparated, and driven forth either by the Belly, or by Urine.</p>
               <p>But if by the Air of a hotter Country, that doth concoct more powerfully, that ſame Tartarous matter be exactly mingled together with the Salt and ſpirit of the Wine, it then refuſeth to be ſevered by the ſeparating faculty, and ſo penetrateth it ſelf into the whole Body with the Alimentary part. But yet becauſe that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unfit to nouriſh the Body, it is at length by Nature thruſt forth unto the Joynts, and there it generateth the Gout. And that this is ſo, we are taught by the experience we have even of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Wines. For although (as experience it ſelf teſtifyeth) they be moſt apt of themſelves to generate the Gout; yet (as we told you a little before) it is obſerved in the deſtillation of the <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and <hi>Reniſh</hi> Wine, that there was more of the Tartarous matter collected out of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> then out of the <hi>Hungarian.</hi> Which happeneth for no other cauſe but this, to wit, that in the Wines of <hi>Hungary</hi> that Tartarous matter is by the ſmalleſt Atomes ſo exactly mingled with the ſpirit of the Wine, that together with the ſaid ſpirit it may likewiſe paſs through by the Alembick.

               <p>THe very Malady doth ſufficiently appear of it ſelf;
<note place="margin">The Diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick ſigns of the gout.</note> and the ſick perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a pain about the Joynts in their Feet, Hands, Knees, and other parts; unto which there is afterward added a ſwelling, a redneſs, and for the moſt part a Feaver. And indeed, when the Gout begins firſt of all to invade a perſon, it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taketh him firſt in the great Toe of his Foot, and that moſt commonly the left. And ſo in all the other joynts the pain moſt of all conſiſteth and ſtaieth in the place affected, without ſpreading any further. But in the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> this pain is not felt only in the Joynt, (by the which the Head of the Thigh is inſerted into the Hip) but it is from hence by the Nerves and Membranes carried unto the very Buttocks, by the way where the Nerves ſpring from the Loyns, and the great bone by the Latin Phyſitians called the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> or holy Bone; and from thence the pain is alſo extended unto the Calf of the Leg, and unto the Foot, according to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and conduct of the Nerve. And in other Joynts alſo, (as lying outwardly) there is wont manifeſtly to appear a ſwelling, and redneſs, and a great heat to be perceived: but now in the Sciatick painful affect theſe things do not ſo plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in regard the place affected lieth very deep, and becauſe that therein that place the top of the Skin hath not many Veins diſperſed here and there in it. In a word; in the Gout that which moſt eſpecially troubleth the ſick perſon is the pain he feeleth, and an impotency in his motion; and upon this there follow watchings and reſtleſneſs, a dejection of the Bodies ſtrength, and other Symptoms; all which <hi>Lucian</hi> in his <hi>Tragop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now in reckoning up the ſigns by which the differences of the Cauſes and the different Humors may be diſcerned,
<note place="margin">The ſigns of the Cauſes.</note> the moſt of Phyſitians are very long and prolix; and they take much pains in reckoning up the ſigns of the Gout from the blood, Choler, Flegm, and Black Choler or Melancholy. But ſince that (as we told you before) thoſe Humors cannot properly be ſaid to excite the Gout, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they are either ſtird up and down by that Humor that is the Cauſe of the Gout, or that being attracted by the pain of the part affected they flow together thereunto; We ſhall therefore in this regard here ſpare our ſelves the Labor, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to treat of them.</p>
               <p>But yet Nevertheleſs, if for the better ordering of the Cure the knowledg of the affluent Humor ſeem to be altogether neceſſary and requiſite; it appeareth from the general diſcourſe of an inflammation; in which we have declared what a pure <hi>Phlegmone</hi> is, and what ſigns it hath; as alſo the ſigns of <hi>Oedematodes,</hi> of <hi>Eriſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelatodes,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Schirrbodes,</hi> what ſigns theſe have; and indeed from the ſigns of the Humor predominant in the Body (which we have elſwhere explained) and likewiſe from the qualities of the ſwelling, and by the obſerving of thoſe things that benefit or hurt the ſick perſon, it may eaſily be known what humor it is that floweth together with it.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding it is here acknowledged by the more learned and able Phyſitians, (even thoſe who have aſſerted that the Gout proceedeth from divers humors) that there is little heed to be given, or regard to be had unto thoſe ſigns that are taken from the Color, heat, or the like Accidents; ſince that very many things occur which may be the Cauſe, as of the Colour, ſo likewiſe of the heat and coldneſs of the Member, contrary unto the Nature of the peccant Matter. For the humor (as <hi>Guainerius</hi> ſaith) that is the true and proper cauſe of the Gout, abiding in the bottom of the Member, doth not for the moſt part change the ſuperficies of the ſaid Member; and ſo then the Color of the Member cannot afford us any ſign or token at all: but it may poſſibly ſo happen, that a Humor abounding in the Body may by pain be ſtirred up and darwn unto the place affected, and there it may cauſe a ſwelling, and yet nevertheleſs it may not be the Cauſe of the Gout.</p>

               <p n="1">I. THe Gout for the moſt part is a diſeaſe not Mortal.
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlicks of the gout.</note> For albeit that the ſtrength may be much impayred by pains, and for want of reſt, (inſomuch that the ſick perſons may at length be forced to take their Beds) yet this is not done, but in a long time. And we ſee that ſuch as are troubled with the Gout do oftentimes live long, and attain unto old age; to wit, for this Cauſe, that Nature by certain inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals thruſteth forth unto the Joynts thoſe vitious Humors from which other more dangerous Diſeaſes might have been generated; and ſo by this means freeth the principal parts from vitious Humors.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If yet notwithſtanding there happen any dangerous inflammations, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious Feavers, or that Nature fayl and lie under the burthen, ſo that it can no longer expel the vitious Humors, the Patients life may then be much endangered. And if any ſuch dangerous Symptom be Joyned together with the vehement pain of the Joynts (as ſuppoſe, a Delity, the trembling of the heart, difficulty of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, cold ſweats, and a weak pulſe) it is then a ſign that the ſick perſon will die the very ſame day, or the day following.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But although the Gout be for the moſt part a Diſeaſe not Mortal, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it is very hard to cure; and it is commonly accounted the ſhame and diſgrace of Phyſitians. For albeit (if the Diſeaſe be new) it may be cured without much difficulty: yet nevertheleſs, if it be long delaied, and that it often invade the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it may be more difficult to cure, in regard that the ſoynts, yea and the very Bowels are weakened by the pains, and redleſneſs, and likewiſe by the aſſlux of the Humors. And the ſick perſons are themſelves oftentimes the Cauſe that this Diſeaſe taketh ſuch deep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oot in them, ſeeing they do not oppoſe and withſtand the Diſeaſe at its firſt Invaſion; yea and oftentimes they conceal it; and ſome there are that will pretend other Cauſes of their Diſeaſe, as loath to acknowledg it to be the Gout.</p>
               <p>But now this Diſeaſe proveth afterward very hard to cure, both in regard of the many errors in Diet (from which the fick perſons wil not be perſwaded to abſtain) and oftentimes alſo through the unskilfulneſs of the Phyſitians; who are either ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the true cauſe of the Diſeaſe, or elſe they adminiſter Medicaments that are very unfit and improper, by which they do rather weaken the Joynts and the Bowels then any waies ſtrengthen them. But yet nevertheleſs, in the mean time, the Gout is not a Diſeaſe that in it ſelf is altogether impoſſible to be cured; and this we are taught by the examples of many that have been freed from the Gout; of which more anon in the <hi>Tenth Queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Whoſoever they be that being thus affected are grown in age, or have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about their loynts <hi>Callous</hi> and hard knobs bunching forth; or that live an anxions and careful life; or have a dry and coſtive belly; theſe can none of them be cured by the Art of Man, or any human means, ſo far as I could ever yet find, <hi>Hippocrater</hi> in the Second of his <hi>Predictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. If in the Gout there happen to be a looſening of the Joynt, it is then very difficult in the curing, or indeed altogether incurable. For although the Joynt may poſſibly be ſet back again in its proper place, yet nevertheleſs becauſe that the Ligaments of the Joynts are made more looſe, a perfect Cure is ſcarcely to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. And if likewiſe in the looſning that followeth upon the Gout the Cavity of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>illed up with a hard knotty matter, the Diſeaſe is then altogether incuteable: for the Joynt cannot be put back again before that Tophaceous matter be taken away; and this will hardly ever be removed.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Among all the ſeveral kinds of the Gout, the <hi>Sciatick</hi> pain is of all others the moſt grievous, not only in regard of the greatneſs of the pain it ſelf, but by reaſon alſo of the grievouſneſs of the Symptoms that follow thereupon. For by reaſon of the moſt grievous pain it canſeth watching and a reſtleſneſs, kindleth fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and ſomtimes a looſning of the Joynt happeneth, upon which there followeth a lameneſs and a waſting away of the whole Leg and Thigh. For if at any time a Joynt ſal out of its place, by reaſon of the multitude of the affluent Humors, there
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37365:53"/>is then a Neceſſity that an halting and lameneſs muſt follow upon it. But becauſe that the bone being fallen out of its proper place preſſeth together the Muſcles, Veins, and Arteries, the Aliment and Spirits cannot poſſibly flow into the lower parts, whereupon there followeth a waſting and Conſumption of them.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But although this <hi>Sciatick</hi> pain be of all others the moſt vehement, yet notwithſtanding, it doth in the beginning more eaſily admit of a Cure then any of the other kinds of the Gout, in regard that the ſtrength and Virtue of the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may more eaſily penetrate unto the Veſſels, (by which the Humor floweth into the Hip) then unto the extream Joynts; and ſo likewiſe the Humor that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto them may the more eaſily be evacuated. But if the Humor be once flown in, ſo that it hath inſinuated it ſelf into the Hip, it is then very hard to be cured; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Diſcuſſing Remedies by reaſon of the fleſh lying upon the Joynt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not penetrate whither they ought to go.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>They that having been long infeſted with the pain in their Hips have the Hip falling forth of its place, and again returning and falling into its place, theſe have ſnot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Excrements following thereupon,</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Hippocrates <hi>telleth us in the</hi> ſixth Section <hi>of his Aphoriſm. Aphoriſ.</hi> 59) theſe Mucous and ſnotty Excrements having their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the weak heat of the Nervous parts.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>They that having been long infeſted with the pain of the Hips have the Hip fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of Joynt, theſe have their Thigh waſting, and they become lame, unleſs they be burnt: as</hi> Hippocrates <hi>tells us in the ſame place, Aphoriſm.</hi> 60. The Thigh indeed conſumeth and waſteth away, becauſe it is but ill nouriſhed, by Reaſon of the weakneſs of the Native heat from the long continued afflux of the Vitious Humors; and becauſe that the Veins and Arteries are moved out of their places, and preſſed together, ſo that they cannot rightly bring the aliment unto the Thigh. But then they become lame, and halt, becauſe that the Thigh for want of nouriſhment is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of ſtrength and by Reaſon of the Luxation or disjoynting is become ſhorter then before, and that by means of the looſneſs of the Ligaments the Thigh bone is not faſt and firm.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Thoſe unto whom the Gout is hereditary are ſcarcely ever wholly freed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; and if they deſire ſo to be, they have need to obſerve a far more exact kind of Diet and a more accurate uſe of Medicaments, then do others that are either not troubled at all with this affect; or if they be, the grief deſcends not to them from their Parents, or any of their Anceſtours.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. If the <hi>Varices</hi> happen unto ſuch as are troubled with the Gout, the Gout then ceaſeth, (as <hi>Avicen</hi> tels us, becauſe that the Humors that were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to flow unto the Joynts are now derived unto the exterior parts of the Thigh.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. If the Gout that was wont to keep its certain Periods ceaſe and return no more, it proveth to be the Cauſe of moſt grievous and deadly Diſeaſes, unleſs the matter be drawn forth by way of prevention, which is moſt difficult to be done. For the matter that Nature was wont to thruſt into the joynts, if by Reaſon of the weaknes of Nature it can be now no longer expelled, either it ſticketh about the Bowels, and principal parts; or elſe being tranſmitted unto the Lungs, Inteſtines, or other parts, it there exciteth moſt grievous Evils.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <note place="margin">Whether the Gout may not be finiſhed in leſs then forty daies and why?</note> As for what concerns the very Paroxyſm it ſelf, touching this <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writeth in his ſixth <hi>Sect.</hi> and 49. <hi>Aphoriſ. They that are troubled</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the Diſeaſe of the Gout, theſe may in fourty daies be cured of their fits, by removing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation; provided that</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Galen <hi>adds in his</hi> Comment.) The Phyſitian fail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Cure, and that the Patients be obedient unto his preſcriptions. For ſeeing that the Humors in the Gout are diſperſed by the Ligaments, Membrans, and Nerves and that theſe parts are more thick, and more cold then the fleſhy parts, it is therefore no wonder at all, that there is a longer time for the diſcuſſion of the Humor required in theſe parts, then in the fleſhy parts. But yet this Aphoriſm is here only to be underſtood of the laſt and very utmoſt term; ſeeing that experience teſtifieth, that many have been Cured of the Gout within fewer then fourty daies. For in ſome the fits of the Gout are more moderate, and ſhorter, and ſo may be made to ceaſe in a ſhorter time: but in others they are more ſharp, and of longer continuance; and therefore require the longer time. And ſome there are that refer the cauſe unto the Humors; and thoſe tel us for a truth, that the Gout which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37365:53"/>proceedeth from Choler is ſhorter, but that which is from Flegm of longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. But be it ſo indeed, that ſomtimes the Blood, ſomtimes Flegm, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Choler may together and at once flow unto one and the ſame part; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, that very Salt Humor which is the next and moſt immediate cauſe of the Gout is ſomtimes thinner, (ſo that it may be the ſooner and more eaſily diſcuſſed) and ſomtimes it is more thick. Unto which we may in the Second place add, the ſtrength or weakneſs of the part affected. For the ſtronger the part is, the more eaſily doth it diſcuſs the Humor that hath flown unto it; but the weaker it is, the more ſlow it is in diſſipating the ſaid Humor; and from hence it happeneth that thoſe which firſt begin to be troubled with fits of the Gout have theſe fits ſhorter; and in ſuch as have been longer troubled with this Diſeaſe the Paroxyſms are of ſo much the longer continuance, unleſs they have the greater care of themſelves. For the ofther any member is afflicted with the Gout, the weaker ſtil it groweth. And Thirdly, the lick perſons themſelves alſo do not obſerve one and the ſame courſe of Diet; whereupon it is, that ſuch of them as obſerve an accurate and exact kind of Diet, theſe are more eaſily freed; and ſome of them do by the Errors of their Diet much prolong unto themſelves their Paroxyſms, and give the Cauſe of a new fluxion.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The more, and the more frequent the Symptoms are that follow upon the Gout, the harder is the Diſeaſe to be cured. For ſomtimes by Reaſon of the moſt ſharp and vebement pain, the ſick perſons do unſeaſonably deſire repelling and ſtupefying Medicaments; which drive back the Humor that was flowing unto the Joynts unto the more noble parts: and from hence it happeneth, that the ſick perſons fall into the affects of the Heart by Reaſon of its being ſtreightned; into Faintings, and Swounding ſits, or other miſchievous Diſeaſes: yea and they may be caſt into great peril of their lives; and then the only hope they have of eſcape lieth in this; to wit. that the aforeſaid Humors (if it poſſibly may be) be again driven back unto the joynts.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Now there are four manner of waies to diſſolve and cure the Gout.
<note place="margin">Four ways of diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Gout.</note> For firſt of all (and more frequently) the matter is reſolved, and indeed all of it, ſo that there are not left ſo much as any footſteps thereof remayning; or (as for the moſt part) nothing but the very ſigns and footſteps of it are left behind: And <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (but this is more rare) the matter is changed into a ſubſtance very like unto <hi>Pus.</hi> For a true and genuine <hi>Pus</hi> it is not; but a certain <hi>Sanies,</hi> or thin Ichorous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, ſweateth back and Eateth its way through both the Fleſh and the Skin.</p>
               <p>But now why the Gout cometh ſo ſeldom unto a ſuppuration,
<note place="margin">Why the Gout is ſo rarely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated?</note> is well worthy our conſideration, and enquity. Some are of this Opinion, that it is therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the joynts are removed from the Fountain of heat, and have not in them ſo much heat as is requiſite for a ſuppuration. But that this is not the true cauſe, appeareth by this, that ſometimes there ariſeth an inflammation in the ends of the Fingers, which yet nevertheleſs cometh unto a ſuppuration. And therefore a more true cauſe ſeemeth to be this, to wit, the Nature of this very Humor it ſelf (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salt, and wheyiſh) which is not to be changed into <hi>Pus;</hi> but it is either inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſipated; or if any of it be left remaining, it groweth and hardneth into knots and knobs. The Third way and manner is, when by Reaſon of the weakneſs of the place, the matter ſticking over long in the part affected, is at length turned into a knot or knob. And of ſuch a Gout as this it is that <hi>Galen</hi> writeth (in his 10. <hi>B.</hi> of the <hi>Compoſit. of Medicam. according to the place,</hi> and 2. <hi>Chaſt.</hi>) <hi>after that the Calli are once produced,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is no further hope or expectation, that the Joynt ſhould ever exactly return unto its priſtine Conſtitution.</hi> And of this the Poet, <hi>Tollere Nodoſam neſcit, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The Fourth manner is, when the Humor is transferred, and carried unto ſome other place, and (as it ſomtimes happeneth) unto the more noble Members, to wit, the Lungs, the Heart, the Brain; and this of all other the changes is the worſt, and by reaſon whereof the ſick perſons die, unleſs the matter be drawn back again unto the joynts; and ſomtimes the Humor is tranſlated unto the more Ignoble
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37365:54"/>parts, as the <hi>varices,</hi> according to what we ſaid before in the 11. <hi>Prognoſt:</hi> and ſomtimes it is evacuated quite out of the Body; and as <hi>Rhaſes</hi> tels us, it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times carried unto the Inteſtines, and there it exciteth a flux of the Belly, and excoriateth the ſaid Inteſtines; and this flux continueth ſomtimes all the life after, and the ſtrength by degrees and by little and little failing, (by reaſon of Feavers and pains) the ſick perſons after long waſting and conſuming by Maraſms, at length they die.</p>

Which difference and variety of opinions, (as we have ſomtimes already told you) hath not been the leaſt (but indeed the greateſt) cauſe why ſo few of thoſe troubled with the Gout have hitherto been cured thereof; each Phyſitian here ſetting himſelf to oppoſe that as an enemy which he hath often to himſelf fancied ſo to be, and in the mean time altogether negreeting that which is indeed the true enemy.

               <p>And in the firſt place indeed for the manner of Curing the Gout that is preſent, there are three things eſpecially, which (in the Paroxyſm) the Patient deſireth a ſpeedy removal of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pain, Swelling, and the Impediment of his motion. And now ſeeing that all theſe three have their original from a preternatural Humor fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the joynt, the total removing of the Paroxyſm confiſteth in this, that the influx of the Humor be withſtood, and that the Humor already fallen in be taken away. For that Humor being removed, there followeth both a ceſſation of the Pain, and a vaniſhing of the ſwelling, and the motion of the part again returneth. But yet nevertheleſs, in regard that the pain doth oftentimes ſo extreamly excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate and Torture the ſick Perſon, that he cannot well beat it (until the Humor the Cauſe thereof be taken away) the pain is therefore ſomtimes firſt of all to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, yea even before the Cauſe be wholly removed. And ſo then the whole Cure of the Gout afflicting the ſick Perſon conſiſteth in the taking away of the Cauſe, and the mitigation of the pain.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, ſeeing that the flux taketh its beginning from the motion and boyling as it were of the blood and Humors in the Veins, that motion and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Humors is firſt of all to be ſtopt; and the Humors that with violence ruſh unto the part affected are not only to be turned another way, but they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be wholly evacuated, and emptied forth out of the Body; for unleſs this be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37365:54"/>done, the pain wil be but the more exaſperated. And afterwards the humor that hath flown in is to be diſcuſſed and ſcattered. And becauſe that pain is the thing that chiefly grieveth the ſick Perſon, this is ſomtimes alſo to be mitigated even before the Cauſe be taken away.</p>
               <p>And therefore if any Cauſe, either external (to wit, the diſtemper of the Ambient Air) or the thickneſs of the body ſhal have given the occaſion, it is forthwith to be removed, yea and alſo to be corrected after a quite contrary manner.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Veneſection.</head>
                  <p>And ſecondly,
<note place="margin">Veneſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> If Blood abound in the Body (which may be alſo ſo moved by the violent motion of the humor that it may as it were boyl, and by the pain be attracted unto the part affected, and ſo concur as a Joynt Cauſe of the Gout, and may poſſibly likewiſe augment the Malady) and that moreover a Feaver be threatned as neer at hand, or elſe if it ſhal accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it; then in this caſe (if the Patients ſtrength wil bear it) Blood-letting is to be inſtituted, that ſo the afflux unto the part affected may be diminiſhed, and that that ſomenteth &amp; addeth ſewel unto the approaching Feaver may be withdrawn, and yet notwithſtanding ſo that there be not too great a quantity of the Blood evacuated. But if there ſhal be no danger at al threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the abounding of the Blood, or that alſo a flegmatick humor aboundeth, Veneſection is in this caſe rather hurtful than any waies uſeſul and profitable, in regard that then by the evacuation of the Blood the Spirits may be diſſipated and the Native heat waſted; whereupon the heat in the part affected may be ſo weakned, that it may not be able to overcome the humors in the part affected, and ſo eaſily to ſcatter them; and hence it is that the Patients are longer ere they can recover their ſtrength and health: yea and ſomtimes alſo there are by this means hard knobs and knots generated in the Joynts. And if all or moſt part of the Joynts be affected, then the baſilique Vein (either in the right or left Arm) is to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But if one only Joynt be affected, then the oppoſite Vein is to be opened. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if the Joynts in the right Arm be affected, the Vein in the left Arm is to be opened: and ſo on the contrary. If the right Foot be troubled with this grief, then the Vein of the right Arm is to be opened; if the left Foot, then the Vein in the Arm is to be opened on the ſame ſide. For this is more commodious, than to open the Vein in the Foot of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide: for by that former Veneſection the fluent humors are drawn back; whereas by this latter they are only derived unto ſome other part. And the like is to be done if the pain be in the Hip.</p>
                  <p>Veneſection in the Arm (in the Sciatica pain) being premiſed for derivation, a Vein may afterwards very fitly be opened in the Ham, or neer unto the interior Anckle (or alſo the exterior) in the Vein there appearing, which (by reaſon of the great benefit it bringeth unto the ſick Perſon, if it be then, and that in due time opened) they cal the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiadick</hi> or Seratick Vein, which (and that very often) alone cureth this Affect. But yet for the moſt part it is opened in the pained Thigh; although that <hi>Platerus</hi> writeth, that upon the opening of a Vein alſo in the ſound and unpained Thigh very great benefit hath followed thereupon, and that all the pain hath thereby been ſuddenly and unexpectedly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
                  <p>But in regard of the urgency of the Malady, and that the Flux cometh very ſpeedily, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore even forthwith (if there be occaſion) Veneſection is to be inſtituted, and as much of the Blood as is needful (if the ſtrength of the Patient wil bear it) to be taken forth at once opening of the Vein. But if the Patients ſtrength wil not bear nor allow of a more large evacuation of the Blood all at once; then at ſeveral times, and by intervals ſo much of the Blood is to be drawn forth as may anſwer unto the Bodies fulneſs thereof.
<note place="margin">Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes, and Leeches.</note> Inſtead of this Venefection Cupping-glaſſes may alſo be applied, which are wont to be affixed (in the very firſt beginning of the Pains) unto the ſound oppoſite part with Scarification. And ſo likewiſe Leeches applied in the accuſtomed places for the Hemorrhoids bring ſome kind of benefit unto the ſick Perſon by their drawing forth the Blood.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Revulſions by the Evacuation of the Blood being thus made,
<note place="margin">Purgation.</note> purging is then next of all to be appointed unto the Patient; touching which although there be ſome that think otherwiſe (as we ſhal afterwards further ſhew you in the 11.

But it is inſtantly to be ordained (even in the very beginning of the pains, or if occaſion be, when they are ſuſpected as nigh

For even then when the humors have already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been in their motion, and are become thin, and that Nature her ſelf endeavoreth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of them, as burthenſome to her, from the good Blood, (and that there is cauſe to fear left that, as we ſaid before, ere ever any ſuch things as theſe can be done and finiſhed the humors may ruſh unto the Joynts, and that by pain and want of reſt the ſtrength be too much dejected, and that a Feaver following thereupon forbid a Purgation) even then the Purgation is forthwith to be inſtituted. And the exhibition of one only Purge doth for the moſt part leſs hurt and offend the ſtomack than thoſe ſo often repeated digeſtive Potions, which reſolve and weaken the Stomack, ſo that the Crudities being afterwards augmented, there is cauſed a greater afflux of humors unto the Joynts.</p>

                  <p>And then Secondly, It is to be conſidered, by what Medicaments the Purgation is to be inftituted and begun. Some think that we ought to abftain from the ſtronger ſort of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, and to make uſe only of thoſe that are more mild and gentle (or of the ſtronger in the ſmalleſt quantity) becauſe that a ſtrong purge may draw ſtore of humors from the more ignoble and external parts unto the more noble; and ſo it may ſomtimes happen that ſome of theſe ſick Perſons may by a vehement and ſtrong Purge fall into burning Feavers, as alſo Feavers Malignant and Mortal. Which as we willingly grant, and think that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that were ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> before are not by vehement Purgers to be more inflamed; and that the motion of Nature is not altogether to be diſturbed: ſo alſo on the other hand we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that great care ought to be taken, that the humors be not only ſtirred and moved up and down in the Veins, and not wholly drawn forth, and ſufficiently evacuated. Which when it happeneth, they afterwards ruſh with a greater violence unto the part affected, as unto the which they are withal attracted by the pain. And therefore in the beginning of the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xyſm, or when it is nigh at hand, we ought to make choyce of Medicaments that are ſomwhat ſtronger than ordinary; and yet notwithſtanding ſuch as do no way offend the Stomack. For (as we ſaid before) if we make uſe of thoſe that are too gentle and weak in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the humors are then only moved up and down in the Body, and nothing worth ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of is evacuated; whereupon there is afterward a greater Conflux unto the part affected.</p>

                  <p>But now, that during the purgation there may be no Conflux unto the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the Humor being moved by the Purgation may not ruſh unto the part affected, this we ought carefully to prevent; and it is done by placing the part affected in a higher place in the Bed, until the Purgation ſhall be fully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But now we cannot in general deſine, with what kind of Medicaments this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is to be performed, in regard of the great variety there is in Bodies. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Humor (the nigheſt cauſe of the Gout) be wheyiſh, Salt, and Tartarous; yet nevertheleſs this very Humor is in divers Bodies conſtituted after a different manner; and hurrieth along with it other Humors alſo that abound in the Body. Yea and in one and the ſame Body the ſame Medicaments are not alwaies fit and proper, becauſe that the ſtare of the Body is not evermore one and the ſame. And therefore the Phyſitian ought to be preſent with the Patient, when he preſcribeth ſuch like Remedies.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Evacuating of Serous Humors, and Cholerick <hi>Ichores,</hi> ſuch as theſe following ought to be provided, <hi>viz. Syr.</hi> of <hi>Roſes</hi> ſolutive, <hi>de Spina Cervma, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Domeſtick Syrup) Manna, Mechoacan, Sene, the Seeds of wild Saffron,</hi> and the compounds from any of theſe; as alſo <hi>Electuar.

Triphera Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica, de Succo Roſarum.</hi> And ſo likewiſe in the ſtronger kind of Medicaments, thoſe are of ſpecial uſe that are made of <hi>Hermodactiles;</hi> and among them the <hi>Cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocoſtine Electuary</hi> of <hi>Bayrus;</hi> of which we ſhal anon make ſurther mention, when we come to ſpeak of the <hi>Preſervation</hi> from the Gout. Or,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Or, Elſe let the Patient make uſe of the Pills of <hi>Rhaſes,</hi> which (as he writeth in his 9. <hi>B.</hi> to <hi>Manſor.

                  <p>But now, although the ſerous or wheyiſh Humor be the nigheſt cauſe of the Gout; yet notwithſtanding becauſe that this Humor doth alſo violently carry along with it other vitious Humors in the Body (and eſpecially when the pain cometh) the Phyſitian therefore ought to be preſent with the Patient, when he is to preſcribe ſuch various purging Medicaments for the preſent occaſion of the ſick Perſon.</p>

Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Sarſaparilla, one ounce, Saſſafras Wood half an ounce, the Root of the Clove Tree one ounce; Citrine Saunders two drams;</hi> Infuſe all in three pints of Water, for twenty four hours, and afterward boyl the ſame; and give of this Decoction one draught in the morning, either alone, or elſe with Harts horn.</p>

                  <p>The Body being thus in a due manner evacuated,
<note place="margin">Topicks.</note> and the Antecedent cauſe (that would have augmented the Diſeaſe) being once taken away, we then come to the very moderating of the pain, and the taking away of the Conteining Cauſe of the pain and ſwelling, and ſo unto the Topicks. But if Topicks ſhall preſently be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, before thoſe Univerſal and General Remedies ſhall have been firſt made uſe of, the Patient ſhall receive from thence far more hurt then benefit. For either the matter which Nature endeavoureth to thruſt forth to the Joynts is driven back unto the more inward parts (from whence very grievous Symptoms are excited:) or elſe it is impacted into the Joynts, and ſo the pain is exaſperated: or elſe the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37365:56"/>part is effeminated and made weak, and looſened; and ſo the flux is increaſed. Which being not commonly taken notice of, and Topicks being oftentimes moſt unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and without any caution at al adminiſtred, the ſick perſons do for the moſt part receive more hurt then good from them; and from hence it was that the common and received opinion had its firſt original, to wit, that the beſt courſe is, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter nothing at al unto the pained Joynts. And the truth is, that it is fir becter to apply nothing call (but to commit the whole buſineſs to Nature,) then to make uſe of ſuch Medicaments as are altogether unfit and improper.</p>
                  <p>Now the Topicks that are applied, they reſpect either the pain only, or elſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the Cauſe of the pain, to wit, the Humor that now and formerly hath flown in, exciting both a pain and a ſwelling.</p>

                  <p>The Pain in this Diſeaſe for the moſt part is a moſt grievous Symptom,
<note place="margin">Mitigaters of Pain.</note> and which is moſt troubleſom to the ſick parties, and which they moſt of all Curſe and Bann, (as <hi>Lucian</hi> hath it in the beginning almoſt of his <hi>Tragopodagra</hi>) and therefore alſo it is that they moſt of all deſire the removal thereof. And indeed it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary that the Phyſitian ſhould have regard thereunto, becauſe that if it be too great, it cauſeth a reſtleſſneſs, dejecteth the ſtrength, and by attracting the Humors it augmenteth the Malady, and ſo deſervedly draweth our care unto it, for its removal; (as <hi>Gaien</hi> in the 12. of his <hi>Method, C.</hi> 1.) and thereupon it ſheweth, and pointeth us unto the aſſwaging thereof by Anodynes. Now Anodynes or Mitigaters of pain have likewiſe this Good and benefit going along with them, to wit, that by looſning the parts they make that the Humor that before flowed only unto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour parts about the Joynts, comes now alſo to flow and be diffuſed unto the Ambient and fleſhy parts. And hence it is that the pains in the Gout, before the ſwelling of the part, are moſt Vehement and Intollerable; and that ſo ſoon as the part affected beings to ſwel, they are much Mitigated.</p>
                  <p>But now theſe Anodynes of what kind they are, we have told you elſwhere, (in our <hi>Inſtitutions</hi>) to wit, ſuch as mollifie and looſen the part affected, and yet do not diſcuſs the very Cauſe it ſelf. And here they may be provided of Goats Milk newly drawn out of their Dugs, as alſo white bread and Milk, together with the Yelks of Eggs, and a little Saffron; as likewiſe of the Leaves of Marſh-Mallows, Mallows, Colewort, or Cabbage, laid upon the place affected as hot as the Patient can wel endure them; as alſo of Mallow Seeds, Seeds of Marſh-Mallows, Quinces, Fleabane, (and eſpecially the Mucillages of them) Caſſia newly drawn out of the Pipe with the Decoction or Water of Nightſhade; which (as <hi>Avicen</hi> tels us) is the beſt Remedy that can be; unto which (if there flow any hot Humors thereunto) we may add ſome of the Oyl of Roſes, or Roſe water; but if the flowing Humors be cold, then we are to add thereto the Oyl of Camomil: and inſtead of Caſſa out of the Pipe, we may likewiſe make uſe of the Rob of the Elder Tree; of white bread and Wine; and indeed if the Humor be more hot, red Wane; but if cold, or betwixt both, then white Wine with the pouder of Camomile flowers and Oyl of Roſes; of Cheeſe new made of ſheeps Milk, and impoſed upon the pained part, and often changed; of freſh-made Ox or Cow dung in the firſt beginning of the Spring, as alſo the Water that is diſtilled out of it. Amoſt uſeful Remedy alſo is the <hi>Mucillage</hi> of <hi>Fleabane Seed</hi> extracted with the Water of Roſes or Night ſhade; unto which ſomtimes a little Vinegar may be added; and this Medicament is by <hi>Serapton</hi> and others very much commended.</p>
                  <p>In the very firſt beginning of the Diſeaſe, <hi>Solenander</hi> taketh the thick ſtalks of Hendock, and ſils them with Salt, and then ſtoppeth them with Clay or Paſte, and puts them in a moiſt place that the Salt may diſſolve; which liquor he keeps in a glaſs, and with Clothes applieth it unto the pained part.</p>
                  <p>And he oftentimes alſo made uſe of this Cataplaſm:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Mallows, the whole Herb, Root and all, cut it into very ſmal pieces; and boyl it in equal parts of Wine and Vinegar, in a new Earthen Veſſel, until a third part be waſted away; and then mingle therewith the thicker Bran of Rye, as much as will ſuffice for the making of a Cataplaſm, and apply this hot unto the grieved part.</hi>

                     <hi>Forreſtus</hi> relateth, that he knew one that added hereunto a little Barly flower, and that of the Water Lentile, boyled in Milk with Camomile flowers; and ſo reducing them into the form of a Cataplaſm, he put them upon the part affected with miraculous ſucceſs, as one could judg no other of it. And here alſo very uſeful is the Yelk of an Egg reduced into the form of a Liniment with the Oyl of Violets; and ſo is alſo the Water of the Sperm or ſeed of Frogs, which perhaps have in them ſome kind of Narcotick quality. <hi>Adrianus Spigelius</hi> writes, that among the <hi>Moravians</hi> there is in uſe a very notable Remedy, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble experiment (for the ſpeedy cuting of the Gout-pains) to wit, the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Meadow Sweet,</hi> diſtilled with its Roots and Flowers; and this water is likewiſe in frequent uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Silefians.</hi> And it is alſo very convenient to foment the part affected with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of <hi>Parietary</hi> or Pellitory of the Wall.</p>
                  <p>And very many there be likewiſe that make uſe of Oyls and Fats. But here we are to give you this Caution (and good cauſe there is alſo for it) that theſe Oyls and Fats are warily and carefully to be made uſe of. For in regard that the Gout hath often ſome kind of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> as to the cauſe thereof; and that it is a thing generally wel known, how that all fat things that ſtop up the pores in the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> do more hurt than benefit; the very ſame ſeemeth likewiſe to be feared in the Gout, leſt that the Pores being ſtopt up by theſe fats, the humor being detained within, the pain may be augmented; and this even very experience teſtifieth. And it was related unto me by a certain honeſt Neighbor of mine, that he himſelf in the aſſwaging of the Gout pains in his own Body, found nothing to be better than Cheeſe of Sheeps Milk new and freſh made, and laid on, but often renewed. For no ſooner did the Cheeſe begin (being made hot by the heat of the part) to become fat, and to drop forth butter as it were, but (as he ſaid) his pain was thereupon very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>the Pith of wheaten Bread half a pound, and boyl it in as much new Milk as wil ſerve to make a Cataplaſm: and then add of the mucilage of Marſhmallow ſeeds two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the meal of Linſeeds and Fenugreek of each two drams, Powder of Camomil flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers and Melilote, of each one ounce, Saffron one dram, Oyl of Roſes and Camomil, of each half an ounce, and mingle them wel together.</hi> Or,</p>

                  <p>Take <hi>of Linſeeds and Fenugreek ſeeds equal parts of each: let the Mucilage be drawn out of them with Roſe-water; and then add the yelks of two Eggs, and a little Vinegar; and then ſprinkle in Bean Meal, and make a Cataplaſm.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Meal of Barly, of Linſeed, of Fenugreek, of Beans, Powder of Camomile flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, of each half an ounce; Marſh-mallow Roots one ounce, Oyl of Roſes and Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, of each one ounce and half; Yelks of three Eggs, the Rob of Wine one ounce, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle them and make a Cataplaſm.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>the flowers of Mulleyn as much as you think fit; infuſe them in a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Red Wine for two months, and then let them be diſtilled; let the place be fomented with the diſtilled water, and then after anoynted with the Oyl or Liquor of Mulleyn flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers that is in the Summer time collected by the Sun-beams in a Glaſs cloſe ſtopped.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>the yong and tender buds of the Hazel Tree; preſs the Oyl out of them after the ſame manner as it is wont to be made of Linſeed. The Body of it that remaineth after the preſſing forth of the Oyl, let it be burnt; and out of the Aſhes let there be the Salt drawn forth with pure ſpring water, and let this be mingled with the aforeſaid Oyl. The Oyl when it is mingled with the Salt, let it be clarified by pouring and paſſing it through a Box
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37365:57"/>of Wood (as Painters are wont to clarifie the Oyl of Linſeed for their own uſe) and ſo it becomes a very excellent Medicament for the mitigating of pains.</hi>
                  </p>

The new and freſh Leaves likewiſe of Tobacco, bruiſed and laid upon the pained part do aſſwage the pain. And the ſame <hi>Platerus</hi> (as likewiſe other Authors) have here recourſe unto <hi>Opium</hi> alſo, and they mingle it together with other Anodynes; and unto two ounces of theſe they add a dram of <hi>Opium.</hi> And he writeth alſo, that if it be diſſolved in the infuſion of the Spirit of Wine alone, or the infuſion of Saffron (four ounces of the yelloweſt of it) and one ſcruple of Camphyre with a dram of Opium, and the part where the pain is be wel waſhed or bathed with the ſaid Liquor, it is a moſt efficacious and ſoveraign Remedy. And ſo likewiſe the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate Antidores, as Treacle, Mithridate, Philonium, may be added while they are new, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in caſe the quantity of the Opium may be augmented.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding we are not to continue long in the uſe of theſe Opiates, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they are enemies unto the native heat, and Nerves.</p>
                  <p>And yet nevertheleſs the ſame <hi>Platerus</hi> tels us (in the firſt <hi>B.</hi> of his Practice, Chap. 5. of the burting of the Touch) that he could never find that the Skin could be made ſtupid and ſenſleſs of pain by any external Narcotick applied thereunto, albeit (that ſo he might know ſomwhat of a certainty) he had applied a Maſs of Opium when he had firſt ſoftened it, unto the part pained with the Gout.</p>
                  <p>But the truth indeed is, that Narcoticks when they are adminiſtred do very eaſily aſſwage the pain; but then withal it being ſo that they hinder the motion of the humors unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts, they may alſo very eaſily cauſe ſome inconvenience, and make the pain longer, ſince that the pain is wont to return again in a ſhort time after.

Antonius Ferrus</hi> (in his 2 <hi>Tract of the Gout, Chap.</hi> 9.) writeth that he had often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had experience of this Remedy; and that when all other Remedies were to no purpoſe, he betook himſelf unto the pouring of cold Water upon the part, as unto his laſt ſhift, and that the pain was forthwith aſſwaged thereby. And the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth is, that it cannot indeed be at all denied, that cold Water being poured forth upon the pained part doth not only drive back, but likewiſe produce a kind of ſtupidity and benummedneſs, and thereby aſſwage the pain: but it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red leſt that by this means the innate heat of the part be deſtroyed, and ſo a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs brought upon the part, by reaſon of which the Malady may afterward be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more grievous, and moreover the Humor may be impacted into the part, and there condenſed and thickned; or elſe haply by this violent Repulſe the Humors may be made to ruſh unto the more inward parts.</p>

                  <p>But now as for Topicks,
<note place="margin">Repellers.</note> (that are directed unto the Cauſe) and in the firſt place, touching Repelling Medicaments we ſay, that although they are by ſome commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet alone they have here ſcarcely any place at all. For ſeeing that Nature her ſelf hath ordained this Motion, and that ſhe endeavoureth to drive forth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Humors from the more internal unto the external parts that are leſs noble, if this motion be hindered, and the Humors driven back again unto the internal and more noble and principal parts, this cannot be done without the extream hazard of the life; and hereupon there will ariſe the worſt and moſt dangerous Symptoms, that will not ceaſe, unleſs Nature again expel forth the vitious Humor unto ſome other Joynt.</p>
                  <p>And moreover, when the pain is a little mitigated, in regard that the matter is diffuſed unto the external parts that are about the Joynt, if by the Repellers it be driven back unto the internal parts, the pain happeneth then to be increaſed; and hence it is alſo, that very many cannot ſo much as endure the cold Air from without (neither yet ſomtimes the external Air although it be not ſo very cold) but that there is a Neceſſity of covering the affected Member, if they expect to have their pain Mitigated. And furthermore if the matter hath already flown out of the part into the Joynt, by the uſe of Medicaments that drive back and Cool it is made more thick and impacted into the part, and ſo the Malady rendred more difficult to be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But yet never the leſs if by the ſudden and overgreat afflux of the humors (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as are more hot) the pain be much increaſed even in the very firſt beginning of the ſit, (in ſo much that it ſeemeth to cal for all the Care, and to require that al the means that are uſed may be for the removal thereof, and that therefore we have a mind to moderate it, and ſomwhat to drive it back) we may then indeed make uſe of Repellers, but not of them alone and by themſelves, but mingled with Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes, Venefection and Purgation having gone before. Like as on the Contrary, we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37365:58"/>are not in the beginning to make uſe of thoſe Medicaments that are over looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſince that they help forward the afflux of the Humors; but we ought in the firſt place to make uſe of thoſe Medicaments that do ſomwhat ſtop and ſtay the afflux of the Humors. And therefore we may then lawfully add <hi>Lettice, Sengreen, Purflaine, Violets, Plantane, Roſes,</hi> (and ſuch Compounds as are made out of them) as alſo what <hi>Vinegar</hi> we think fit.

                  <p>But now when the force and violence of the fluxion is once paſt and gone,
<note place="margin">Diſcuſſives.</note> and the part become ſwoln, then thoſe things are withall to be mingled which do cal forth the Humor, and gently diſcuſs the ſame and ſo take away ſome part of the Cauſe. But now here Phyſitiaus are wont (for the moſt part of them) to be very long and Tedious in reckoning up, and diſtinguiſhing the ſeveral Medicaments; which of them are fit and proper in a hot Cauſe, and which of them when the Cauſe is cold; yea and which of them are moſt convenient for all kind of Humors. But although we deny not but that we are in ſome kind of manner to have reſpect unto the Condition of the Humor that floweth in unto the Joynts; yet nevertheleſs our chief and main Care ought to be, that the ferous and ſharp wheyiſh Humor (which is the nigheſt and moſt principal Cauſe of the pain,) may be called forth of the more deep and cloſe parts in the Joynts unto the external parts, and that they be inſenſibly diſcuſſed; and yet that this may the more conveniently be ſo done, we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (as we ſaid but now) have ſome regard unto thoſe Humors that the aforeſaid ſerous and ſharp Humor forcibly draweth along with it, and which by Reaſon of the pain are together attracted to the part that is pained, and which are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken for the higheſt and moſt immediate Cauſe of the Gout. Yea and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37365:59"/>moreover that very ſerous Humor it ſelf (the prime and principal Cauſe of this Evil) is in ſome more, and in others leſs hot. And therefore if the flowing Humor be more hot, then the diſcuſſing Medicaments ought to be ſo ordered, that they may indeed gently diſperſe the Humor; but yet ſo that they give no occaſion at all for any new afflux. And ſuch a like hot Humor, inregard that it is withall moveable and thin, is eaſily diſcuſſed; neither needeth it any ſtronger Medicaments. But if the Humor be leſs hot, or ſomwhat cold, then we may very ſafely adminiſter Medicaments that are more hot. Neither will there be any Cauſe to fear that then a new flux may eaſily be excited; and therefore for the diſperſing of ſuch a like Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor there are neceſſarily required ſuch Medicaments as are more hot then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
                  <p>But now with what Medicaments that wheyiſh, and (as it is ſo called by the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts) Tartarous Humore is to be drawn forth and diſcuſſed, we are here (and that for very good Reaſon) diligently to make inquiry. For we have elſwhere told you (viz. in our Tract of <hi>Chymic. Confil. &amp; Diſſ. Chap.</hi> 15.) that the Medicaments ought in their own kind to be like unto the Cauſe. For there is not any thing that ſuffereth from every thing; neither is there any thing that may be united unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing. Gum Arabick, and Tragacanth, and the Gum of Cherry Trees are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by Water, becauſe of the neer alliance and agreement in their Natures; but but ſo is not Sulphur, and other things of a Sulphurous Nature, and thoſe things that are Oyly. Sulphur is diſſolved by Oyl, but not by <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> although the ſaid Water is able to diſſolve ſilver, and other Metals. The hands when they are all foul with Pitch or Turpentine are not to be made clean with Water, but with Oyl, or ſome thing elſe that is fat. In burnings we uſe not to adminiſter cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but Linſeed Oyl, Verniſh, and the like (that may draw forth that fire and burning) are to be applied. And ſo in the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> (or other wiſe called <hi>Roſa</hi>) we ought not to impoſe thoſe things that are fat, and Oyly, but ley tempered with Oyl; and Sope that is diſſolved in Elder Water, and the Like; which do not at al ſhut the pores, but yet nevertheleſs they draw forth and diſcuſs that ſubtile and hot Humor. And the very ſame is the caſe in the Gout; and ſince that it hath its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal not from a Watery Humor, neither yet alſo from that which is Oyly or Sulphurous (as the Chymiſts ſpeak) but from a Humor that is ſharp and Salt, for the drawing forth and diſſipating of this Humor, thoſe things that contain in them a volatile and flitting Salt are rather to be adminiſtred, then thoſe things that are fat and Oyly. And experience hath already taught many, that the Gout pains are increaſed by ſuch things as are fat. And hence it is that the Chymiſts do ſo much commend (and not without cauſe) <hi>Salt Armoniack,</hi> oftentimes ſublimated, diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Wine, or ſome other convenient liquor, and ſo impoſed upon the pained part. Others commend the Salt of Urine, in like manner diſſolved in Wine, or ſome other liquor. And whereas <hi>Adrian Spigelius</hi> writeth that he ſaw when a Mans Urine (being kept till it was Stale) was laid upon the part affected (the pains as yet abiding, and continuing even in their heighth) and that it was wonderfully benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall in giving eaſe; and how much rather then muſt the Salt of Urine perform this? Yea and there are ſome that uſe likewiſe other Salts to evacuate the aforefaid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. And I my ſelf know alſo one that was wont to adminiſter the ſpirit of Salt tempered with other liquors, And very fitly may it be tempered with the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Meadowſweet;</hi> for being then with a Feather laid upon the part in pain, it extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Humor in ſuch a manner, as that it may even ſeem to exhale in the likeneſs of a Vapor. Yea ſome there are that commend alſo thoſe things that are wont to be made uſe of for the cauſing of redneſs in any part, and the raiſing of bliſters when there is occaſion; and theſe they mingle with <hi>Anodynes.</hi> Neither are theſe things the inventions of the latter Phyſitians, and the Modern Chymiſts; but that plants abounding with a volatile and ſharp Salt were heretofore in uſe likewiſe with the Ancients, for the curing of the Gout, we are taught even by that one plant which we call <hi>Lepidium</hi> or <hi>Sciatica Creſſes;</hi> whoſe Roots (as they write) being bruiſed, and mingled with old Greaſe, are (with ſingular benefit) applied unto thoſe that are troubled with theſe pains of the Gout; as it appeareth out of <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides,</hi> and <hi>Damocrates</hi> (whoſe verſes upon this ſubject we may read in <hi>Galen</hi> his 10. <hi>B. of the Compoſition of Medicaments according to the place</hi>) and <hi>Aetius, Tetrab.</hi> 3. <hi>Serm.</hi> 4. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. and others. And as touching Muſtard Seed, <hi>Alexand. Tralleanus</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:37365:59"/>writeth, That he knew a certain perſon who by the uſe only of the ſaid Muſtard ſeed ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with dried Figs (in extraordinary great pains ariſing from a cold Humor) was freed from the ſaid pain of the Gout. Some commend the wild Radiſh throughly bruiſed; and I my ſelf have ſeen that it hath done good to many. If we fear its Acrimony, and that from thence ſome heat may be excited, we may then firſt boyl it a little.</p>
                  <p>The Liquor of Snails is likewiſe very much extolled by ſome: as,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Snails taken forth of their Shels, in number twenty five: the berries of Danewort or Dwarf-Elder, and Salt, of each as much as will ſuffice.</hi> Theſe being put into the Alembick in a clean Veſſel with holes through the bottom thereof, let there be a Veſſel put under it that may receive the Liquor as it diſtilleth; in the which you are to wet cloaths, and apply them unto the part affected.</p>
                  <p>This Suffumigation is likewiſe much commended.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Lign.

The firſt is this:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Water of the Sperm of Frogs, of white Mullein, and Sallow, of each a quart and half a pint: the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine of a Boy that drinketh Wine, three pints: Treacle new and freſh two drams and half: Vitriol, Salt diſſolved, and Allum, of each four ounces: Let them be diſtilled (till they be dry) upon the Embers: then add Salt of Vitriol one ounce and half: Camphire and Saffron, of each two drams, and mingle them.</hi> Let Linen cloaths be throughly wet in this Water, and applied unto the grieved part, and be very often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
                  <p>The Second Water is this:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Salt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine of a Child, of each as much as you think fit, and then diſtil them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is this,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Leaves and Flowers of green Elder, of each one pound: let them be well bruiſed and macerated in a ſufficient quantity of Wine (for three daies together) in</hi> Balneo, <hi>and afterward let them be diſtilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Water is this:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Spirit of Wine rectified one quart; the pureſt Honey one pound: Let them be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled in</hi> Balneo; <hi>and let two Liquors be gathered from hence ſeverally and apart, to wit, One watery, and the other Sulphureous. Add unto the remainders, of whol Saffron one ounce and half; Venice Turpentine two ounces; Tartar calcined to a whiteneſs half a pound; Salt one ounce; the flegm of Vitriol four ounces; Lye made of the tender ſhoots of the Vine two pints: Let them be macerated for twenty four hours, and then diſtilled till they be dry. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the feces that remain add the firſt Water, and let them be diſtilled. And at length mingle together all the Liquors, and diſtil them in a</hi> Balneum <hi>where they may evaporate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Andreas Libavius</hi> (in the firſt part of his <hi>Apocalypſ. Hermet. Cap.</hi> 8.) preferreth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others that Water in which Braſs and Iron have been extinguiſhed, and afterwards <hi>Mercurius vitae</hi> hath therein been macerated. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>venice Soap one ounce and half; Spirit of Wine, Water of Elder Flowers, of each two ounces, and mingle them.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>River Creviſhes eight in number; Juniper grains one handful; Myrrh and Frankincenſe, of each one ounce; the beſt Wine one pint, let them be diſtilled.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Maſtick, Frankincenſe, Myrrh, Ammoniacum, and Bdellium, of each two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Vitriol one pound; Honey a quart, Tartar an ounce and half; Spirit of Wine the beſt, four pints: let them be diſtilled according to art.</hi>

                     <hi>Solenander</hi> (in his 24. <hi>Conſil. Sect.</hi> 5.) writeth, That he knew an old man that was much troubled with the Gout, who made for himſelf a Medicine in this manner. When there was a ſwelling, and a real pain, and the place red, he took Salt, Cinders, the Urine of a Child, and Vinegar; in theſe (wel mingled together, and ſtirted up and down) he through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moiſtened a white woollen cloth, and then ſqueezing it he applied it now and then unto the part that was pained. And when he had now by this means in great part aſſwaged the pain, and the diſeaſe declining, he boyled live Sulphur, and the pouder of white Hellebore in the Oyl of Linſeed, and with it he anointed the places affected. And the ſame <hi>Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander</hi> writeth alſo that this following was known to benefit many that made trial thereof. There groweth unto the Roots of the Oak (in the Autumn for the moſt part) a certain
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37365:60"/>kind of Muſhrom that is red and tender, and proportionably big enough, according to the growth of the Tree, which he therefore calleth <hi>Hypodrion</hi> (the ſame no doubt that we have made mention of above in our 3. <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Practice, Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. touching the <hi>Dyſentery:</hi>) this when he hath cut it into many ſmal thin ſlices, with Salt finely poudered he puts it into an Earthen pot; ſo ſprinkling the aforeſaid Salt that every laying of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pieces may receive ſome thereof betwixt each other: he then puts them deep in the Earth for certain daies; and as for the brine which at length he findeth melted in the pot, he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it all together, and this he keepeth to anoint the joynts when they are pained. But becauſe that it vehemently drieth and diſcuſſeth, and wonderfully ſtrengtheneth the part that is made looſe by the Humor, he tels us therefore, that it is beſt to uſe it in the very firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the pain, and before it hath gotten unto any heighth; or elſe in the end and decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Paroxyſm, to conſume the matter, and to add ſtrength and firmneſs unto the part; and more eſpecially if there be now and then interpoſed a fomentation and waſhing of the parts with the Decoction of <hi>Mulleyn, Wormwood, Camomile, Bears-ears or French Cowſlips, Sage, Ground-pine or Herb Ivy, Mugwort, Roſemary, Melilot,</hi> and others of this kind, that have a power to cut, cleanſe, diſcuſs, meanly to dry, and ſtrengthen.</p>
                  <p>And this Plaiſter is likewiſe very much commended.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Gum Caranna one ounce and half, Gum Tacamahaca ſix drams, the Oxycreccum Emplaſter, nine ounces, White Wax five drams, Powder of the greater Conſound two drams, With the Oyl of Camomile make an Emplaſter according to Art; which being applied unto the pained part doth greatly draw forth the matter, and eaſe the pain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of ſuch Kind of Medicaments as theſe there are many more in great abundance to be found in <hi>Platerus</hi> his ſecond Book of Practice, and elſwhere in others.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding I think it not amiſs, here to give you notice of this, that in the applying of all manner of Topicks we are diligently to heed the ſigns of thoſe that benefit, and thoſe that hurt and offend. For albeit the nigheſt Cauſe of the Gout be a wheyiſh, ſalt, and tartarous humor (or cal it by what name ſoever you pleaſe) yet nevertheleſs it is not for nothing that the Chymiſts give us notice (as we ſhal further ſhew you below in the <hi>ſixth Queſtion</hi>) that there are in the Earth and Plants divers kinds of Salts; or as <hi>Plate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ſpeaketh, that the humor the Cauſe of the Gout is mingled with the <hi>Ichores</hi> of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humors, which render the ſame more vehement and violent. And hence it is, that not only in divers and ſeveral Perſons, but likewiſe in one and the ſame Perſon, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſeveral ages, the nature of the pain is different, and not evermore one and the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And then laſtly, for the diſcuſſing of the Reliques and Remainders there may be made fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of Mugwort, Organy, Wormwood, Betony, Calamint, Flowers of Arabian Staechas, Lavender, Camomile, Melilote, boyled in Wine and Water, which withal ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the part. But here <hi>Crato</hi> doth rightly adviſe us (in his <hi>Conſil.</hi> 240) that we we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet notwithſtanding if there be a few more Plants boyled in the Water, and a little ſalt added; or elſe if a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> or Ley, be poured thereunto, there is no diſcommodity to be expected from the humectation; or if we do at all fear any hurt, leſt that the wateriſh humidity ſhould after the hath be left in the part affected, the following Trochiſks may be caſt upon the Coals of Fire, and the ſmoak received by the part affected.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Gum Juniper, and Frankincenſe, of each two drams; Ladanum and Benzoin, of each one ounce; Cinnamom, Cloves, and Nutmeg, of each half a dram; make them into a Powder, and incorporate them with Gum Tragacanth; and then make Trochisks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe very much commended a Bath of Juniper Wood, as alſo of the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a whol Fox, adding thereto Frogs and Earth-worms, and the Heths before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe let the Feet be anoynted with ſome convenient Liniment or Unguent. <hi>Galen</hi> (in his 2. <hi>B.</hi> of ſimple Medic. Chap. 18.) as likewiſe many other Authors, do much commed the Chafing and Rubbing of ſalted Oyl into the part affected. For in all thoſe (ſaith <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius tetrab,</hi> 3. <hi>ſerm.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 21.) that are chafed in this manner, the Natural innate heat is augmented, that which is preternatural is diſperſed, the Excrements are conſumed, and the affected Members are rendred more ſtrong, ſo that they are no further obnoxious and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto pains; eſpecially, if from day to day all their whol life long they be diligent in the

Touching which <hi>Philagrius</hi> very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently (and without doubt Hyperbolically) is bold to pronounce (as <hi>Aetius</hi> writeth in the place alleadged) that even this one Remedy alone is ſufficient for them that either moſt of all tranſgreſs in matter of Dyet, or ſuch as are immoderately cooled, or ſick with over hard labor, or ſuch as have been exceſſive in the uſe of Venery, or ſuch (laſtly) as have run into any other error and exceſs.

                  <p>If the matter be now grown into the wonted hard Knobs,
<note place="margin">For the Knots in the Joynts</note> it is indeed a moſt difficult buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to diſſolve them; but if they be not already become old and inveterate, there may be yet ſome hopes left of curing them. Now for the diſcuſſing of theſe knobs and knots we are not only to adminiſter External and Topick Remedies, but likewiſe Internal Remedies. The Internal Remedies are thoſe Antidotes above mentioned, amongſt which the Antidote of <hi>Trallianus</hi> (made of Centanty) is more eſpecially uſeful. And the ſame <hi>Trallianus</hi> writeth likewiſe, That a certain perſon troubled with the Gout, when the knots began firſt to appear, by the drinking of the Decoction of Groundpine or Herb Ivy, he prevented the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generating of them. The External and Topick Remedies (uſeful for the diſſolving of the Knobs) are <hi>Ammoniacum</hi> diſſolved in Vinegar. Or,</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37365:61"/>Sagapenum, of each one dram, Oyl of Orrace, and white Lilyes, of each half an ounce, powder of Orrace one dram, and make an Emplaſter.</hi> Or,</p>

                  <p>The Dirt that is found in ſome certain Baths (having in them a power to Molliſie and Reſolve) are here likewiſe very uſeful; (ſuch as are thoſe of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew,</hi> in the province of <hi>Padua</hi>) with which the part affected is to be fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for an hour, and better, every Morning and Evening, and afterwards to be waſhed with the Bath-Water.</p>

               <p>THe pain of the Hips (commonly called the <hi>Sciatica</hi>) in indeed a kinde of the Gout;
<note place="margin">The Scia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Pain.</note> ſo that there may nothing ſeem needful to be ſpoken as touching it, beſides what hath been already ſaid. But ſeeing that both in regard of the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it hath ſomthing peculiar, and that in the Cure there is ſomething that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thereunto to be obſerved; we ſhall therefore ſpeak a little further there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>There are indeed ſome, who by the <hi>Iſchiadick</hi> or <hi>Sciatica</hi> pain underſtand ſome other affect, differing from the Gout, (which is to be accounted among the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affects) and this happeneth alſo unto thoſe that never were troubled with the Gout, either in the Feet, or in the hands, from excrements there heaped up together, or flowing into that part, and this for the moſt part a little now and then, and by degrees. But it is not our purpoſe here to treat of that affect; in regard that it pertaineth unto the impotency and inability in walking, by reaſon of ſomething amiſs in the Hip; (and extendeth it ſelf further then the Gout; of which only our purpoſe is here to Treat;) and therefore we ſhall here handle the <hi>Sciatica</hi> pain,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37365:61"/>only as it is Arthritick, that is to ſay, a ſpecies or kind of the Gout, of which we have been hitherto ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>But now as touching the place affected, there is here ſome kind of Diſagreement among the learned Phyſitians. <hi>Aetius (Tetrab.</hi> 3. <hi>Serm.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.) out of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chigenes</hi> writeth thus: <hi>They are properly (ſaith he) to be accounted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tebrae. But ſomtimes there goeth before this Malady, (and as it were, to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher it in) a pain of the Muſcles lying neer, and eſpecially the Loyns; but ſomtimes again the beginning of the affect is from the very Joynt it ſelf: but now ſomtimes it ſo happeneth that the pain of the Vertebrae being almoſt taken away, the grief ſticketh only about the Ham, and in ſome neer unto the Ankles, but in others the whole Leg is equally afflicted with pain; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alſo have this pain fixed about their Groyns, and then indeed the grief and trouble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing derived unto the very bladder produceth a difficulty of making Water; and then moſt eſpecially it is that the whole Leg, from the Hips (even unto the very Heel) ſuffereth Pain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fernelius</hi> (in his <hi>Sixth B. of the Diſeaſ. of the parts, and the Symptoms, Chap.</hi> 18.) ſaith, <hi>that the Iſchias or Sciatick pain (being abſolutely the moſt vehement of all the reſt) hath not its ſeat in that Joynt by which the head of the Thigh is inſerted and faſtened into the Hip, but deeper, at the utmoſt of the Buttocks, by which the Nerves that proceed from the Loyns and the great bone, called Os Sacrum, or the holy bone, are carried into the Thighs; the great and terrible pain is not in the Hip alone, but it is likewiſe extended into the Thigh, and into the Calve of the Leg, and unto the extream part of the Foot, to wit whitherſoever that branch that is derived from the Hip affected reacheth and extendeth it ſelf.</hi> But ſome other, (as <hi>Platerus</hi>) attribute the Sciatick pain unto the Joynt, with the Thigh.</p>
               <p>But here we are to underſtand, that about the Hip (as alſo now and then in the ſhoulder) there happeneth ſomtimes a pain, which is indeed very often moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet nevertheleſs it is not properly a pain of the Joynts, in regard that it is not in any Joynt, becauſe it ſeizeth upon the Membrane of the Muſcles; neither again doth it conſiſt alwaies in one and the ſame place, but for the moſt part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth downward unto the inferior parts. And ſuch almoſt is that Iſchiadick pain that <hi>Aetius</hi> hath deſcribed out of <hi>Archigenes.</hi> And I grant that this pain hath its original from the Serous and ſharp Humor that floweth from the Head under the Skin, and ſticking about ſome Membrane, or ſome Nerve: but now, that this pain is not properly the Gout, appeareth from hence; Firſt, becauſe it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not alwaies about the Joynts, but alſo in the middle ſpaces within the Joynts. And ſo I have here Cured a perſon of honor, that ſuffered ſuch a pain in the very Muſcles themſelves that are between the Knees and the Hip. And the like pains often happen in the Breaſt, and there excite a certain baſtard Pleuriſie. And then Secondly, becauſe that they very rarely return by intervals, and conſtantly at ſome certain times; but often after they have afflicted a man once or twice, they return no more afterwards all the whole life long Thirdly, becauſe thoſe that ſuffer theſe pains are not afflicted with the Gout in any other parts, which happeneth in the true Gout, and that is properly ſo called. For thoſe that are long troubled with the Gout are very ſeldom afflicted with the Gout in the Feet alone; but they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuffer pains likewiſe in their Hands, and their other Joynts.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, likewiſe the true Gout (for the moſt part, if not alwaies) hath a Tumor or ſwelling Joyned with it; but now theſe pains have no ſuch ſwelling Joyned with them; not only when they are in a deep place, but alſo when they are in a place that is not deep; as it often happeneth in the ſhoulder; and this cometh to paſs for this Cauſe, to wit, that the Humor floweth not out of thoſe Veins by which that part is nouriſhed, as in the true Gout.</p>
               <p>But we intend not here to treat of that pain, but only of that which is properly the Arthritick or Gout pain But now that <hi>Iſchiadick</hi> or <hi>Sciatick</hi> pain hath this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto it, that it is diffuſed more abroad then in the other Joynts, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unto the places that lie next: and this happeneth, firſt of all, becauſe that the Hip bone is large; from whence it is, that we diſtinguiſh it by three names; and when it is knit unto the ſides of the <hi>Or Sacrum,</hi> we then cal it the <hi>Ileum</hi> bone; when unto the hollow part of the ſaid bone, we then call it <hi>Iſchium;</hi> and when it is Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the forepart, we then call it <hi>Os P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bis</hi> or the ſhare bone. And then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37365:62"/>becauſe that the Nerves that come from the Loyns and the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> to that Articulation are diſtributed into divers parts: and therefore the pain of the Hip doth ſomtimes diffuſe it ſelf into all places, and reacheth even unto the Nerves that are derived from the Hip.</p>
               <p>But now this Malady is very difficult to be cured, by Reaſon of the deepneſs and largneſs of the place, and the abundance of the matter which the wide Place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth. <hi>They who being infeſted by a long continued pain of their Hips have the Hip-bone fallen out of its place, and again returning into its place, theſe have a filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and naſtineſs following thereupon; (in the fixth Section, and</hi> 59. <hi>Aphoriſm.</hi>) For if by the Humor flowing in the Ligaments be relaxed, the Hip falleth out of its place; and the Humor that is gotten into its Cavity is made dul and thick; yea and oftentimes it groweth there into a ſtony hardneſs; whereupon becauſe the Veins and Arteries are moved out of their proper places, and are preſſed down together, thence it is that an Atrophy followeth in the Legs. And if this Iſchiadick pain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade any one in the time of youth, it threateneth the ſhortning of the life, becauſe that by pain and hunger the ſick perſon waſteth and withereth away; and from hence likewiſe the <hi>Iſchiadick Conſumption</hi> hath taken its Name.</p>
               <p>As concerning the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure, for Revuiſion, the <hi>Baſilick</hi> Vein in the ſame ſide is moſt fitly opened; but the <hi>Iſchiadick,</hi> if it be for derivation. And indeed if the pain extend it ſelf more externally, that Vein that is in the outward Ankle; or the <hi>Saphena,</hi> which is at the inward Ankle, if the pain tend more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> likewiſe (6. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>Text</hi> 21.) writeth, that <hi>when there are Kedma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a preſent</hi> (by which <hi>Galen</hi> and others underſtand the fluxions into the Hip) <hi>then the Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns behind the Ears are to be ſcarifyed.</hi> But yet theſe think not that this precept of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is true, or that it ought to be followed. But yet nevertheleſs <hi>Sceggb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us</hi> defendeth <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and thinks that he did upon very good ground propound that which without doubt he had obſerved by experience. For ſeeing that the Cauſe of the evil deſtilleth into the Hip by the hole of the Nook, (or <hi>Fernelius</hi> his way) for the taking away the very Fountain and ſource of the Malady, he rightly determineth that the Remedy muſt be adminiſtred about the Ears. But if all this ſhould be granted, yet nevertheleſs thoſe <hi>Redmata</hi> are not the <hi>Iſchiadick pains</hi> properly ſo called (which belong unto the Gout) but thoſe of which we made mention before.</p>
               <p>The ſtronger kind of Purgations have here their place; and here the <hi>Caryocoſtine Electuary</hi> is of ſingular uſe, as alſo the <hi>Arthritick Pills, Pill. Faetidae,</hi> and the <hi>Pills</hi> of <hi>Hermodactyls. Crato</hi> indeed (in his 247. <hi>Conſil.</hi>) writeth that the <hi>Iſchiadick or Sciatick</hi> pains will not admit of, nor bear purges; in regard that the Humors have ſeated themſelves more in thoſe places: but this is to be underſtood of an inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Purgation.</p>
               <p>And here Vomitories ſeem to be more commodious then Purgers by the Belly, in regard that they evacuate the vitious Humors by a place more remote from the part affected.</p>
               <p>But Repellers have here no place at al, becauſe that it may Juſtly be feared, leſt by the uſe of theſe the blood and other Humors may be driven back toward the part affected, and may be there heaped up.</p>
               <p>Having firſt made uſe of General and Univerſal Remedies, we come then to the impoſing of Medicaments that attract and reſolve, and theſe ought to be of the ſtronger ſort, that they may call forth into the Superficies the Humor that is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into a deep place; which kind of Medicaments are provided of Herbs that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs <hi>viz. The Leaves of Eldern, Danewort or Wallwort, Lawrell, Rue, Betony, Camomil, Ground pine, Roſemary, Melilote, Muſtard Seed, and Staveſacre; as alſo the flies Cantharides, Pitch, Sulphur, Turpentine, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Bdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, Opopanax, and Euphorbium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Excellent likewiſe is that Medicament that is made of <hi>Sciatica Creſſes</hi> (of which we made mention above,) as alſo of <hi>Water Creſſes,</hi> and the Herb <hi>Piperites,</hi> or <hi>Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-wort,</hi> as ſome call it. As,</p>

               <p>But if the Malady wil not yet by theſe be taken away, then we are according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in the ſixth Sect. of his Aphor. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 60.) to burn the part affected; and <hi>Celſus</hi> likewiſe approveth of this advice, whileſt (in his 4. B. and Chap. 12.) he writeth in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the laſt ſhift, and in old diſeaſes alſo a moſt efficacious Remedy, with glowing hot Irons to exulcerate the Skin in three or four places above the Hip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Remedy by heating the part diſſolveth and evacuateth the thick and viſcid humors; and if the Ulcers be kept open (as they ought to be) the vitious matter floweth forth by them. As for the manner of burning, ſee more in <hi>Paul. Aegineta</hi> his ſixth Book, and Chap. 76. and <hi>Albucaſ.</hi> Part 1. Chap. 43.</p>
               <p>And ſome there are likewiſe that make mention of the Gout of the Verrebrae of the Back, in ſpecial: and we grant indeed that now and then ſome ſuch kind of Gout there is; and this hath alſo the very ſame Cauſes and ſo requireth the ſame kind of Cure with the other Gouts. But we are here to look wel about us, and to have a care that we be not deceived, in miſtaking every pain of the Back for the Gout. For oftentimes it ſo happeneth that from the ſerous and wheyiſh matter flowing down from the Head, and deſcending along the Back, and eſpecially according to the Conveyance of the Cucullar Muſcle (and ſticking at the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Dorſi,</hi> in the end of the ſaid Muſcle) a pain may be excited; which yet nevertheleſs is not the Gout, in regard that it happeneth not in the parts pertaining to the Joynt; and it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes likewiſe of a very ſhort continuance, and afflicteth the ſick Perſons in their ſleep, but when they awake, and ariſe from their ſleep, it leaveth them and vaniſheth, which never happeneth in the true Gout.</p>

               <head>Chap. 7 <hi>Of the VVay and Means to prevent the Gout.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MAny there are that mind only this one thing, to wit,
<note place="margin">The way to prevent the Gout.</note> that they may be freed from the preſent pains of the Gout; but being freed they take no care at all, how they may obtain that they be no more troubled with the ſame pains; neither do they make uſe of thoſe Medicaments by which they might prevent this Evil, nor at all refrain from the Errors of their Dyet; and ſo they ſuffer the Malady again to ariſe, and ſo to continue and grow old with them; and therefore it is no wonder, that there are ſo few perfectly recovered of the Gout. But a precaution, and prevention, is altogether as neceſſary as the Cure in ſpecial ſo called.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:37365:63"/>
               <p>Now this Conſiſteth in three things:
<note place="margin">In what things it conſiſteth.</note> The firſt is this, that there be care taken that there be no matter ſuffered to gather together which may flow unto the Joynts. The ſecond, that if any matter be gotten together, it be taken away before it ruſh unto the Joynts. And the third is this, that the Joynts may not eaſily receive the ſame. Now if (as many do) any one ſhal make it his buſineſs only to ſtrengthen the Joynts, and in the mean time ſhal permit the heaping up of the vitious matter in the Body; the Patient ſhal hence reap more burt than good. For if there ſhal be a vitious Matter preſent in the Body, and this not thruſt forth unto the Joynts, after the uſual and accuſtomed manner, being retained in the Body it may flow unto other of the more noble parts, and be the Cauſe of moſt grievous Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>And therefore we are here firſt of all to commend unto the Patient a good courſe of Dyet, and Medicaments that correct the diſtemper of the Bowels; the firſt intention being beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by this. The ſecond thing required is accompliſhed by Blood-letting, Purgings, and other things that take away the ſerous and Tartarous humors. The third, by thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſtrengthen the Joynts.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all,
<note place="margin">The firſt member of prevention is the Dyet</note> As touching the Dyet, this is abſolutely neceſſary, and may do much in the prevention of the Gout; and indeed it is of ſo great conſequence, that without it the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments (let them be never ſo excellent) wil nothing avail. And that ſo few are cured of the Gout, this for the moſt part happeneth by reaſon of the too great liberty and licence they take in point of Dyet. And on the contrary, a due courſe of Dyet hath been known it ſelf alone oftentimes to vanquiſh this Malady: and <hi>Crato</hi> (in his 161. <hi>Conſil.</hi>) writeth truly; <hi>I think</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there is nothing more to be taken care of for thoſe that are troubled with the Gout, than a right and due courſe of Dyet. For what Medicaments are there that can either draw forth the matter it ſelf, or ſtrengthen the Heat?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to likewiſe <hi>Solenander (Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Conſil.</hi> 20.) <hi>We obſerve</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that many by their care and diligence have made themſelves free from the pains of the Gout; ſome by their being obſtemious; others by their forbearance of Venereal embraces; a third ſort, by reaſon of their continual uſing this or that proper Medicament: And others again, by their ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this or that kind of Meat, as hurtful in reference to this their Diſeaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the courſe of Dyet doth chiefly conſiſt in the right uſe of the ſix things not Natural. And firſt of all, as touching the Air, let the exceſs of every Air in its qualities be ſhun'd; (for this may either retain, or diſperſe abroad the vitious humors in the Body) and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the cold exceſs that retaineth and keepeth in the tranſpiration, and that notable exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the vapors; yea and it forceth the wheyiſh humor from the outſide of the Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Centre, where it afterwards ſoon becometh over-hot (and boyling as it were) and then beginneth to be ſtird up and down. And therefore let all thoſe that are troubled with the Gout very carefully ſence themſelves againſt the external injuries of the Air, by wearing of ſuch warm Garments as are fit for them; and let them beware that the external Cold do not thicken the Habit of the Body, and ſo hinder the flowing forth of the vapors. And if it ſhal ſo happen that the habit of the Body ſhal be condenſed, it is then again to be ratified by frequent but gentle frictions.</p>
               <p>But more eſpecially there is an exact and accurate regard to be had unto the Meat and Drink, and the conſtant Dyet of the Patient. For it being ſo that the Meat and Drink is wont to ſupply the matter of the Gout, unleſs the ſick Perſon ſhal abſtain from all food that is hurtful for his grief, or commit any errors in the uſe thereof, he ſhal but in vain hope for health and recovery. And therefore when the ſick Perſons ſhal themſelves come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and take notice what meats are hurtful for them (as we told above of one who by the eating of Carps evermore fel into the Gout) then let them carefully and wholly abſtain from them.
<note place="margin">The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Patients Food.</note> And ſo alſo for the quantity of the food that is taken, it muſt be no more than what ſufficeth for the refreſhing of the Spirits, and the preſervation of the ſtrength of the Body. And he ought not upon any occaſion to take in more food than what may rightly be conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Stomack, Liver, and Spleen: which is then done if he take only that quantity of Meat and Drink that (according to the advice of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) he alwaies riſe from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with an Appetite, and that he never ſo fil himſelf with Meat and Drink, that he leave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining no deſire at all, nor any further appetite thereto. For ſince that in theſe Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that which is excrementitious is wont to be ſeparated, if thoſe Concoctions ſhal not be rightly performed, many Excrements (and thoſe Tartarous) are mingled with the Blood; which afterwads (as altogether uſeleſs) are by Nature, at her own time, thruſt forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Joynts. Or if it ſhould ſo chance that the ſick Perſon offend by taking too much food at one meal, he muſt be ſo much the more ſparing in the meal following. And ſo likewiſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37365:63"/>it will be to very good purpoſe, if once in the week he wholly forbear, or at leaſt that he Eat a ſpare ſupper. And there ought likewiſe no new food to be taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the former be Concocted. His ſupper muſt alwaies be more ſparing then his dinner: and variety likewiſe of Meats at one and the ſame Meal is to be avoided, as being altogether as hurtful as the over great quantity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>And therefore let his bread be pure, and leavened;
<note place="margin">The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Food.</note> the fleſh that he Eateth let it be Wether Mutton, Kids fleſh, Veal, and the like, of a good Juyce and Aliment. There is likewiſe allowed young Beefe, eſpecially in ſuch as are hotter then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and <hi>Alexander Trallianus</hi> in his 11. <hi>B. Chap.</hi> 1. writeth, that he knew ſome who being troubled with an ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Hens, Cocks, and Capons hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>.</note> Some there are that conceive there ought to be an abſtaining from the fleſh of Hens and Capons, and this therefore, becauſe that it yieldeth much nouriſhment. But Meats of Good and much Juyce were never yet known to caſt any one into the Gout, if there were not an Error committed in the Quantity. Others there are that think Cocks, Capons, and Hens, to be therefore hurtful for thoſe that have the Gout, becauſe that they themſelves are now and then troubled with the ſame; which may indeed likewiſe happen for the Cauſe that we ſhall now ſhew you. For (in my Opinion) it ſeemeth moſt agreeable unto truth, that this cometh to paſs, becauſe that Cocks and Hens do likewiſe pick up and Eat Sand, and little Stones, and concoct them in their Maws; from which there may eaſily be derived into their very blood ſomthing that is Salt, Earthy, and Tartarous; and this may afterwards yield matter of the Gout unto him that eateth of their fleſh. And this Opinion <hi>Crato</hi> (in his 246. <hi>Conſil.</hi>) ſeemeth to favour, when he writes that the Capon hath a peculiar humor, which Nature driveth forth unto the Joynts. Let him Eat fiſh very ſparingly; but from Carps, and moiſt fiſh (as Eeles and the like) let him altogether abſtain: as alſo from thoſe Meats that have in them a power to bind the Belly, or that cool the Stomach. And ſo likewiſe the uſe of much Cheeſe is not ſafe. He muſt abſtain alſo from all kind of Pulſe, that contain in them much Earthy Juyce. And becauſe that (as <hi>Crato</hi> writeth in his 247. <hi>Conſil.</hi>) between Wine and the Cabbage there is found to be a certain kind of Natural Antipathy, it is thought very fit, that ſuch as are troubled with the Gout (as unto whom Wine is very hurtful) do often feed upon Cabbage and Barley Bread. And <hi>Pliny</hi> in his 20. <hi>B.</hi> and 9. <hi>Chapter,</hi> writeth thus: <hi>I finde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that many have been freed from the Gout by eating the Cabbage, and drinking the broth thereof being boyled.</hi> And many there are that upon very good ground condemn the uſe of apples; and adviſe the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians (led hereunto both by Reaſon and Obſervation) that they forbid the eating of Apples unto ſuch of their Patients as they finde ſubject unto the Diſeaſes of the Joynts. For Apples abound with moiſture, and this for the moſt part partaking of ſome acrimony, and ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th a power of penetrating (by reaſon of which it is that thoſe ſpots that are cauſed by the Juyce of Apples can ſo hardly be gotten out of Linen) and therefore do very eaſily move the Humors. Let all fat Meats likewiſe be avoided, and eſpecially fried Meats, as ſuch as do not only afford an ill and vitious Nutriment, but alſo corrupt other Meats; as likewiſe Meats over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſeaſoned with hot Spices.</p>
               <p>But a more then ordinary Care muſt be had in the Choyce of the Patients drink. For it is altogether Requiſite that he wholly abſtain from the Moravian, Auſtrian, and Hungarian Wines, and ſuch as are like unto theſe, which do moſt certainly breed the Gout. But as for others (which in ſuch as are found do not ſo eaſily ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate the Gout) they may be drunk, but it muſt be very ſparingly, in regard that even theſe alſo contain in them ſome kind of Tartarous matter.</p>
               <p>Among theſe Wines that are wholeſome, <hi>Solenander</hi> in the 24. <hi>Conſil.</hi> of his 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> reckoneth up likewiſe the Thick, Red, Spaniſh Wine, which they call Alicant, or the Wine they cal Tent: and of this Wine he alloweth a moderate uſe unto ſuch as are troubled with the Gout, as being but little, or leſs hurtful for them. Others commend and allow of the <hi>Pucine</hi> Wine; as likewiſe that they bring unto us from the Vale of <hi>Telina;</hi> by reaſon that they have not in them ſo great a power of hurting the Joynts.</p>
               <p>And if the Patient perceive that even theſe Wines alſo are naught and hurtful for his Diſeaſe, and that they offend him; let him then (if he can) altogether abſtain
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37365:64"/>from the drinking of any Wine; in regard that it may ſo be, that for ſuch as are ſubject unto the Gout, even thoſe Wines may hurt and offend them, which others drink without any hurt at all. And <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> (in his <hi>Third Book of the matter of Phyſick, Chap.</hi> 78.) writeth in this manner. <hi>I have known many</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who by their altogether abſtaining only from wine, have all of them ſenſibly found help. For ſome in the very beginning of their Diſeaſe are perfectly freed from their fits, and others of them afterwards, and in theſe alſo the fits come but ſeldome; and when they come they are extreamly painful. If therefore there happen (from this abſtinence) nothing preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial, either at preſent, or that nothing be feared for the future, let them abſtain from Wine al their Life long. But as for thoſe who by this their abſtinence have brought a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cold diſpoſition upon themſelves, and are thereby rendered unfit for their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when they have for two years abſtaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from Wine, after this let them perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drink a little thereof at a time, and let it firſt be qualified with Water. But as for thoſe that abſtain from Wine, they ought in ſtead of their Wine to drink the Decoction of Aniſeeds, or ſome ſuch like Seed, abſtaining (as much as may be) from Fruits, Apples, and the reſt of thoſe Cooling Fruits.</hi> Thus Aegineta.</p>
               <p>And in very truth, that the Caſe thus ſtands, we have above, (in the <hi>Second Chap.</hi>) proved by examples. And in our own Countries, they that will may far more eaſily abſtain from the drinking of Wine, then thoſe in <hi>Greece,</hi> and elſewhere: in regard that good beer may every where conveniently enough be had, which may ſupply the place of Wine, and very wel ſerve in ſtead thereof. And although it ſeem very hard unto many (yea and hurtful alſo unto ſome) wholly to abſtain from Wine, Yet Nevertheleſs (as it is rightly ſaid by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his 50. <hi>Aphoriſm</hi>) there is alſo ſomtimes a Change to be made unto that which we have not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed unto. But if there be any that will not be perſwaded wholly to abſtain from Wine, (or if indeed they cannot, without great prejudice unto their health, as it very often happeneth) let them then drink Rheniſh Wine, but not ſuch as is ſtrong, or Crude; or elſe the <hi>Pucine</hi> Wine alſo, or the like; and yet neither theſe in too great abundance, but with al poſſible ſparingneſs. And therefore we like very well of <hi>Solenanders</hi> advice, who (in his 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> and 24. <hi>Conſil.</hi>) perſwadeth us, in the uſe of Wine, to have regard unto the Temperament, Conſtitution of the Body, Age, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſtom; ſince that there is great difference in Bodies; ſo that what is good and wholeſom for one, the ſame may to another be altogether uſeleſs and hurtful. And therefore in the uſe of Wines, we are eſpecially to obſerve what benefit or damage the ſick perſon may receive from it. For if it be found that the drinking of Wine hurteth thoſe that are thus affected, there muſt then be a total abſtinence from it; or if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> may not be wholly omitted, it muſt be moſt ſparingly drunk. And as for thoſe who in the uſe of Wine cannot moderate themſelves, nor obſerve a mean and ſet bounds unto their Appetites, we think it fitter to forbid the uſe of Wine unto ſuch perſons, then to allow it them. But yet however al generally are wholly to abſtain from Wine in the beginning of the Paroxyſm. Neither muſt wine at any time be drunk upon an Empty Stomack, but then only when ſolid food is taken. It is likewiſe very hurtful to drink Wine betwixt Meals, in regard that it doth then eaſily penetrate unto the Liver and excite fluxions.</p>
               <p>Let the Patient content himſelf with ſo much drink only as may ſuffice for the ſatisfying of his Thirſt,
<note place="margin">The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of his drink.</note> without cauſing any fluctuation of the food he hath Eaten.</p>
               <p>As for his Sleep and Reſt,
<note place="margin">Reſt and ſleep.</note> let them be moderate; and let him not Sleep imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after he hath Eaten and Drunk: and when he doth Sleep, let it not be above ſeven or eight hours at the moſt; yet ſeven hours Sleep he may well be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
               <p>Let the exerciſe of his Body be moderate,
<note place="margin">Exerciſe.</note> and let it alwaies be before dinner, or ſupper. And if the Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> be true in any Diſeaſe, it is true in this: <hi>viz. The exerciſe of health is this, not to be overſatiated with food, and to be active and induſtrious in pains taking,</hi> and in the works of our calling. And very good it is for thoſe that are able, before dinner ſomtimes to exerciſe themſelves even until they ſweat. But then after this motion and exerciſe of the Body, Let him neither Eat nor Drink, before ſuch time as the heat contracted by the motion be wholly vaniſhed. And if there be at any time an Error committed, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs either of reſt or motion, better it is that it ſhould be in motion, then in idleneſs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37365:64"/>and Reſt. For by Idleneſs and ſlowth the heat is much diminiſhed, and the ſtrength of the Body made to languiſh, the Concoctions to be depraved, and the Excrements not evacuated and driven forth of the Body. Whereupon it is that <hi>Galen</hi> (in the <hi>Sixth Sect. Ephoriſm</hi> 28.) tels us that eaſe and idleneſs is as much the Cauſe of the Gout, as Epicuriſm, and Satiety. And we may ſee by experience that Men addicted to labor and exerciſe are ſeldom or never taken with the Gout. And inſtead of the Morning exerciſe the Patient may likewiſe ſomtimes uſe frictions or Rubbings, ſo ſoon as he is up in the morning. To ſtand much, as alſo to walk overmuch, or to ride long Journeys, is greatly hurtful for ſuch as are troubled with the Gout.</p>
               <p>And in the like manner as Exerciſe and Reſt, ſo alſo ought the Patients ſleep and abſtinence therefrom to be moderate, and alwaies in a mean. And yet of the two extreams, better it is to want ſleep, then to exceed therein; provided that the ſtrength of the Body be hereby nothing impaired, nor Crudities bred. Neither may the Patient accuſtom himſelf to ſleep preſently after meals.</p>
               <p>As for fulneſs and emprineſs, Care muſt be taken,
<note place="margin">Repletion, or fuln<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſs.</note> that the Belly be made every day to diſcharge its office; and that the Humors may not be heaped up in the firſt waies, Eccoprotick or Cutting Medicaments are ſomtimes to be made uſe of; for theſe do gently caſe and empty the Belly. Sweats in the morning are very uſeful and convenient for the prevention of the Gout, in regard that they take out of the Body the ſerous or wheyiſh Humors. And therefore the ſick perſons are by all manner of means to accuſtom themſelves unto theſe ſweats; and to this end, they ought wel to cover themſelves with Bed-clothes at night when they go to Bed; that ſo in the morning if they ſweat not, yet they may have a Moiſtneſs all over their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The Patient ought likewiſe to abſtain from exceſſive Venery,
<note place="margin">Venery.</note> which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Bacchus</hi> (or Wine) is the Parent of the Gout, as begetting and breeding it: for (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> turns it out of the Greek) of Loyn-looſening <hi>Venus,</hi> and Loyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſening <hi>Bacchus,</hi> there is born and bred the Loyn-looſening Gout. For by the overmuch uſe of Venery the whole Body is debilitated, and the ſpirits and Native heat diſſipated; whereupon all the Concoctions are hurt, and many Excrements are treaſured up.</p>
               <p>The immoderate affections of the mind,
<note place="margin">Affects of the mind.</note> (and eſpecially Anger and Fear) are to be ſhunned; and the Patient is rather to give himſelf unto Mirth and Cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>And that kind of Diet which is obſerved by Rich perſons,
<note place="margin">Why the Rich are more troubled with the Gout them the poor.</note> and people of rank and quality, is the true Cauſe why theſe are more frequently taken with the Gout, then poor people, and ſuch as live in the Country. For the Rich aboundeth with ſtore of al kind of Meat, and dainty diſhes; and thereupon they uſually eat of many diſhes at one and the ſame meal; and not only ſo, but they alſo exceed in the quantity, and take too much thereof, even more then they can Concoct; and hereupon Crudities are generated; and eſpecially they too much indulge themſelves in the uſe of Wine. And then again they want thoſe Laborious exerciſes by which the excrementitious Humors in the Body (and chiefly, the ſerous) might be evacuated. And moreover, for the moſt part they abhor all manner of Medicaments; and they wil not at all make uſe of them, unleſs they be fitted for their Palates.</p>
               <p>And ſo in general, thoſe things that are by the Phyſitians (in other Caſes) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as touching a good and orderly Diet, they are here eſpecially to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſuch as are troubled with the Gout; concerning which <hi>Alexander Trallianus</hi> largely treateth, in his <hi>Eleventh B.</hi> and 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> and ſo alſo <hi>Andraeas Gallus,</hi> in his <hi>Conſil.

But as for ſuch as have Naturally a very weak and cold Body, ſuch as theſe receive more hurt than help from this evacuation of the Blood, as <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> tels us in his 3. B. Chap. 78 and ſo likewiſe for thoſe that have already of a long time been troubled with a frequen fluxion; for by thoſe often afflicting pains, and reſtleſſneſs, the Spirits are diſſipated, and the ſtrength of the Body much dejected. But now this Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood is moſt convenient in the Spring and Autumn. But yet in ſome it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that this taking of Blood from them be not done only at once, but by often repetitions, ſome now, ſome then. For if the ſick Perſon be one that uſeth a ful and free D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But becauſe that in the preſervation we are not wont to have any reſpect unto the part affected it ſelf, but only our mind and purpoſe is to evacuate the Blood when it aboundeth, it is moſt fitly taken forth (not only in the <hi>Poda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra</hi> or Gout in the Foot) but generally in all Gouts whatſoever, by opening a Vein in the Arm. But if the Malady be in the Arm alone (as it is in the <hi>Chiragra</hi> or Gout of the Hands) then the Vein in the Thigh is moſt conveniently opened.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome who for ſuch as are troubled with the Gout in their Feet do preſcribe the opening of the Veins in their great Toes, and that every month, and then not all at once, but by repeating it a ſecond or third time: and I my ſelf have known thoſe that have received great benefit hereby. And this practice of theirs is grounded upon Reaſon. For Nature is wont chiefly and principally to thruſt forth the vitious humors unto the extream parts of the Body, and to the Veins, and eſpecially thoſe unto which ſhe is accuſtomed to excite a fluxion. And therefore ſeeing it is probable, that in thoſe who are troubled with the Gout Nature doth ſend the Tartarous humors in greater abundance unto the Veins in the great Toes, than unto any other parts; therefore they are moſt conveniently evacuated by opening a Vein there. Neither can the ſtrength and vigor of the Body be very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred by this evacuation, ſo that it be not in the extream. And that which <hi>Coſtaeus</hi> (in his 3. B. upon <hi>Avicen. Sen.</hi> 22. <hi>Tract.</hi> 2.

And others for the ſame and and purpoſe every month apply Cupping-glaſſes unto the Soles of the Feet; and this muſt be before the new Moon, and without any Scarification at all.

                  <p>Take <hi>white Hermodactyls</hi> (their upper rind being taken off) <hi>and Diagrydium, of each two drams: Coſtus, Cummin, Cloves, Ginger, of each one dram, and make a Pouder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of which the Doſe is one dram, more or leſs. Or elſe being beaten very ſmal and ſearſed, let them be mingled with the Syrup that is made of Honey and white Wine (boyled until they have attained the form of a Syrup wel boyled) and then make an Electuary: The Doſe hereof is from two drams to half an ounce. And <hi>Bayrus</hi> writeth, that ſo ſoon as ever he perceived in himſelf ſigns of Repletion, he took this Electuary three or four times in the yeer; and by this means he kept himſelf (for twenty ſix yeers) altogether unmoleſted by thoſe pains with which he had been formerly aſſaulted. And indeed it wil not be amiſs then to make uſe of ſome Medicament that is proper, when we find there is ſo much of the bumors already collected, that the Paroxyſm ſeemeth to be very nigh at hand. And here we are likewiſe to commend unto you <hi>Rhaſes</hi> his Pills, deſcribed before in the Cure: and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe theſe:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Groundpine or Herb Ivy, half an ounce; Germander, Arabian Lavender, of each three drams; Hermodactyls half an ounce; St. Johns wort one dram: Aloes He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patick half an ounce: with Turpentine of Cyprus make Pills.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now as for thoſe Medicaments that are made uſe of more frequently (every, or every other week,
<note place="margin">Whether or no Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modactyls be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the gout?</note> or three weeks, or a month together) theſe ought to be more mild and moderate. And here <hi>Adrian Spigelius</hi> writeth, that he in the preſervation of himſelf from the Gout never made uſe of Hermodactyls in any Purgation; ſince that it is not requiſite that we draw forth the Humors out of thoſe parts into the which as yet nothing hath flown; but he adviſeth us to content our ſelves with thoſe things that evacuate the humors out of the greater veins; unleſs haply it be in the old knotty Gout (which hath more frequent inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) or that (as we ſaid before) the Paroxyſm be now nigh at hand. Which as we grant it to be true in thoſe Purgations that are more frequently (and in ſhorter intervals) admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred: ſo in thoſe Purgations that are to be twice or thrice every yeer, we conceive that Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modacty is may moſt fitly be mingled therewithal; and theſe al the more experienced Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, even unto our daies, have made uſe of; as without doubt having al of them learned by experience, that Hermodactyls had in them a peculiar power of evacuating thoſe humors breeding the Gout. And the Author of the little B. touching the <hi>Podagra</hi> or the Gout in the Feet, (whoſe name we find not, and yet we find his Book among the Writings of the principal Phyſitians) writeth, that he himſelf knew by experience, That in the Gout (whatever the peccant humor were) that Purgation that was made with Hermodactyls in it was more uſeful and effectual in this caſe than any other. And hence it is alſo that <hi>Rbaſes</hi> his Pills, and the Caryocoſtine Electuary of <hi>Bayrus</hi> have Hermodactyls in their Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But now that thoſe Medicaments may be taken without any nauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A Vomit alſo is here very good,
<note place="margin">A <hi>Vomit.</hi>
                     </note> and bringeth much benefit along with it, if Nature be able

Thoſe kind of Medicaments were with the Ancients of very great uſe; and by them they are greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: and there are very many of them extant in <hi>Aetius</hi> his <hi>Tetrab.</hi> 3. <hi>Serm.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 47. <hi>Alexander Trallianus</hi> in his 11. <hi>B.

                  <p>And among thoſe Medicaments, in the firſt place we meet with Treacle;
<note place="margin">Treacle</note> touching which the Author of the Book of Treacle, to <hi>Piſo,</hi> in his 15. Chapter, wrireth: <hi>But it moſt of all profiteth</hi> (faith he) <hi>when any one ſhall frequently take thereof whiles he is yet well and in health; in regard that it conſumeth the ſuperfluous humors of the whol body, and changeth likewiſe the temperament thereof.</hi> And a little after: <hi>I adviſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that every man in ſuch like diſeaſes would uſe Treacle; becauſe that it both drieth up the ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and permitteth not that any other be bred; whereupon very many from the uſe of this alone in the beginning have been altogether freed from the Gout.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Aetius</hi> in the place alleadged hath this deſcription of the Antidote conſiſting of four things,
<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote of four things</note> by ſome called a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Gentian, Bayberries, Mirrh, equal parts, and make a pouder.</hi> Give hereof eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day half a ſpoonful in hot Water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oribaſius</hi> in the place alleadged hath another deſcription hereof.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Germander one pound; Gentian, round Ariſtolochy or Birthwort, of each two ounces; Rue ſeed one ſextary: Let them be well bruiſed and ſearſed.</hi> Give dayly hereof one ſpoonful.</p>
                  <p>That which is made of ſeven things, hath as followeth:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>St. Johns wort one ounce; Centaury, and Groundpine, of each three ounces;
<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote of ſeven things, The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote of Cantaury</note> Gentian five ounces; round Ariſtolochy one ounce; Agarick three ounces; Parſley one ounce; Attick Honey ſive pound.</hi> The Doſe one dram in three Cyaths of Water.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Aetius</hi> chiefly commendeth the Antidote of Centaury; and he writeth that he knew many cured by the uſe thereof; and that it was ſo wholſom for ſuch as were troubled with the Gout, that the uſe thereof had enabled many that had been affected herewith fifteen yeers, and ſo wel recovered them that they went journeys on foot; and that it was grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the ſtomach, convenient for the belly, and provoking much urine. The manner of making it is thus:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>the tops of Centaury the leſs, Roots of Centaury the Greater, Germander, Gentian, round Ariſtolochy, of each alike, as ſuppoſe one pound.</hi> Let one dram hereof be given (for fourty daies) out of hot water; and in the other three hundred twenty five following daies of the yeer, let half a dram be adminiſtred after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame <hi>Aetius</hi> likewiſe very highly commendeth the Antidote of St. <hi>Johns wort,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote of St. Johns wort</note> as that which cureth al manner of Gouts, the Diſeaſe of the Hips, and al diſeaſes of the joynts in general, being drunk for the ſpace of one whol yeer; that it warmeth and cheriſheth the ſtomach, maketh the ſight ſharp and quick; and that it maketh the reſt of the ſenſes alſo mote cleer, and fitter for the diſcharge of their ſeveral Offices; that it gently evacuateth the Urine; and that it is excellent good in the falling-ſickneſs, that it freeth from the great and grievous pains of the head; and laſtly, that it mollifieth the Liver and the Spleen when they are hardened into a <hi>Schirrus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the manner of making it is this:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Germander nine ounces; Centaury eight ounces; round Ariſtolochy ſeven ounces; Gentian Root ſix ounces: the tops of St. Johns wort five ounces; Parſley four ounces; Spignel three ounces; Valerian two ounces; Agarick two ounces; Honey well ſcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med three pound.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander Trallianus</hi> greatly commendeth this Antidote of the Philoſopher <hi>Heraclitus</hi> as much approved of by many. <hi>Viz.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Spicknard two ounces; Gentian, long Ariſtolochy, round Ariſtolochy or Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37365:67"/>the beſt Myrrh, Bayberries, Rhapontick, of each half an ounce.</hi> The Doſe is one dram. The beſt time to take it is the beginning of the Spring, and the Autumn; and indeed in thoſe places and perſons that are cold, the Spring time; but in others that are more hot, the Autumn.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Trallianus</hi> preferreth the <hi>Diacorallium</hi> Antidote before al other Antidotes whatſoever;
<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corallium:</note> which is thus made:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>of Corals two drams; Mirrh four ounces; Cloves half an ounce; Rhapontick one ounce; Peony Root the like quantity; long and round Ariſtolochy, of each two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Spicknard four ounces; and make hereof a Pouder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of this he giveth in the morning one ſcruple, out of warm water; and after it he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth abſtinence from al kind of food for ſix hours (but yer the truth is, a ſhorter time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting may ſuffice) &amp; maketh the beginning hereof about the Kalends of <hi>January,</hi> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth adminiſtring of it for a hundred daies (by reaſon of the long continued perſeverance of the Indication, as <hi>Cappivaccius</hi> explaineth it:) and then for thirty daies he intermitteth the adminiſtring of it (becauſe of the ſtrength and powers of the body, that they may be recollected, as the ſame <hi>Cappivaccius</hi> tels us.) And then again he adminiſtreth it for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred daies mote; and ſo again, as before, he intermits for thirty daies. When the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty daies (wherein there were two hundred potions adminiſtred) are over and paſt, he then giveth it again, but now not every day, but only every other day; and ſo in a hundred and three ſcore daies he adminiſtreth fourſcore Potions. And afterwards again in two hundred and ſixty daies he adminiſtreth eighty Potions, giving them every thud day until the three hundred ſixty five Potions ſhal have been al taken. But he warneth them that take this Antidote. that they abſtain from Anger, Venery, Aſtringent and ſweet Wine, al kind of bitter Pot-herbs, the heads of Fiſh, Crabs, and Creviſhes, Lobſters, Eels, Hares fleſh, al kind of Pulſe, but more eſpecially Beans. And many more of ſuch like Antidotes there are to be found in <hi>Paulus Aegineta, Aetius,</hi> and <hi>Trallianus,</hi> in the places before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged.</p>
                  <p>Out of theſe afterwards (in the Ages not long before ours, and in our Age alſo) there aroſe divers other ſuch like Compoſitions. <hi>Thomas Eraſtus</hi> telleth us that he had two of theſe communicated unto him, and extolled with high commendations: One of them that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by an Italian Phyſitian (who called it the Pouder of <hi>Jupiter</hi>) and was imparted unto him by Doctor <hi>Conradus Geſner,</hi> is made in this manner following:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Round Ariſtolochy,
<note place="margin">Jupiters Pouder</note> ſuch as is right, the true Rhapontick, of each one ounce; Macedonian Parſley ſeed half an ounce; Germander tops, Centaury the leſs, and St. Johns wort, of each ten drams: make a Pouder hereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt month give every day one dram hereof, out of warm Water; and afterwards half a dram, for one whol yeer; every month you muſt alſo order the Patient to take a purge or two; or elſe (for ſuch as are flegmatick) you may intermingle the Pouder of Agarick with the aforeſaid Pouder, a little to purge the ſick perſon.</p>
                  <p>The other Compoſition beſtowed on me by Dn. D. <hi>Chriſtoph. Wirſung,</hi> an Auguſtan Phyſitian, is thus to be made:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>the true round Ariſtolochy, Gentian, Rhapontick, or Centaury the greater</hi> (but I think the true Rhapontick to be better) <hi>the tops of Germander, Groundpine or Herb Ivy, of each alike, and make a Pouder.</hi> Let there be one dram hereof taken for the one half of the yeer; and for the other half of the yeer half a dram.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Johannes Mattheus</hi> (out of an old Manuſcript) produceth this Pouder, as he there findeth it preſcribed, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Rhapontick one ounce; Agarick two ounces; Valerian three ounces; Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Parſley ſeed, and Spignel, of each four ounces; Gentian, and Ariſtolochy, of each fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ounces; Germander nine ounces, and make a Pouder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Donzellinus</hi> his Pouder is as followeth:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Germander, Groundpine, both the Centauries</hi> (or only the leſſer) <hi>Marjoram, Sage, Betony, Gentian, and Birthwort, of each one ounce: the beſt Guajacum eight ounces or one pound: and make a Pouder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by this one Remedy alone <hi>Donzellinus</hi> writeth that the Gout may be perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, provided that a man live not like unto a <hi>Sardanapalus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Crato</hi> his Pouder is this.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Ariſtolochy one ounce, Centaury the leſs three drams; Gentian ſix drams; Spig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, five drams; St. Johns Wort, ſix drams, Parſley of</hi> Macedonia <hi>half an ounce, Agarick two drams, Rhapontick, or (if that may not be had) Rheubarb one dram; and make
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37365:67"/>a Pouder.</hi> Of which he giveth in the morning two ſcruples in the Water of Groundpine, or Betony Water (with the Syrup of either of the two former) in <hi>January</hi> five daies, in <hi>February</hi> as many, in <hi>March</hi> two, in <hi>May</hi> three, in <hi>June</hi> one, in <hi>July</hi> two, in <hi>Auguſt</hi> one, in <hi>September, October, November,</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> two: but it matters not much if it be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener taken; only as he ſaith it wil be ſomwhat better to take it in the manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faid.</p>
                  <p>This following is Doctor <hi>Manard</hi> his Pouder.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Germander, Dittany of Crete, Groundpine or Herb Ivy, Roots of the greater Centaury, and round Ariſtolochy, of each two ounces: the inward Rinds of Walnuts one pound: make a Pouder.</hi> The Doſe is one dram for forty daies.</p>
                  <p>This Pouder next following is attributed unto <hi>Eraſtus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Harts-horn burnt, Beef bones burnt, the Kernels of the Citron, Dates, Jaws of the Luce-fiſh or Pike, equal parts: burnt Coral, and burnt Ivory, of each half parts: make hereof a Pouder.</hi> Unto which (for the taſts ſake) you may add a little Cinnamon, Mace, and Cloves; and with Sugar make a Pouder.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet nevertheleſs the ſick perſon is not ſtrictly and preciſely to be tyed unto any forms of Pouders; but of the ſame ſimple Medicaments there may with Sugar or ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Syrup be made Electuaries or Pills (which for the moſt part are very fitly made up with Turpentine of Cyprus, ſince that moſt of thoſe that are troubled with the Gout are likewiſe obnoxious and ſubject unto the Stone) or Extracts, or thoſe Medicaments they cal Eſſences, or liquid Extracts, or a Wine, or a Medicate Drink; that ſo in this manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the palat of the ſick perſon may be pleaſed.</p>

                  <p>Take <hi>the Conſerve of Germander three ounces: of Herb Ivy, and Betony Leaves, of each one ounce and half: Seeds of St. Johns wort, Roots of round Ariſtolochy, of each half an ounce; Angelica two drams: the bones of a Man prepared, red Corals prepared, Ivory prepared, of each one dram: Cloves and Cinnamon, of each two drams: and with the Syrup of Betony make an Electuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we may likewiſe add the Medicaments of latter Phyſitians, viz. their Magiſteria, their Feculae, and their Salts; as alſo Margarites, and Crabs Eyes. As,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Roots of Spignel or Maſterwort.

                  </p>
                  <p>For the cauſing and provoking morning ſweats there are alſo given Syrups of the Berries of Eldern prepared with Sugar two ſpoonfuls; and if you pleaſe there may likewiſe a little Harts-horn be added.</p>

                  <p>Take <hi>Balm, Valerian, Juniper Berries, of each what you think fit; Let them be ſprinkled with good ſweet Wine; then macerated in Balm Water, and afterwards deſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>But now in the Judgment of very many of Decoction of <hi>Groundpine</hi> may ſerve in ſtead of all the aforeſaid Medicaments,
<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Ground pine:</note> and will do better than any one of them; and therefore it was likewiſe highly commended unto the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth by the Phyſitians of <hi>Genoa:</hi> and <hi>Solenander</hi> in his <hi>fifth Sect. Conſil.</hi> 1. tels us, that it hath been found by experience, that very many which had drunk of this Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ſpace of threeſcore daies, have been wholly freed from the Gout, and reſtored unto their healths; whereas before they had both the Joynts of their hands, and of their feet alſo grievouſly afflicted and tortured by this Diſeaſe. And no wonder, for it attenuateth the thick Humors, and conſumeth them; driveth forth the Excrements by Urine, or elſe by ſweat evidently; or elſe it inſenſibly diſcuſſeth them by tranſpiration: and it ſtrengtheneth alſo all the internal bowels, and every kind of Nerve, yea and the whole habit of the Body. But becauſe that <hi>Veſalius</hi> writeth ſo largely and fully touching this <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Groundpine,</hi> and the advice given by the Phyſitians of <hi>Genoa</hi> (as we may ſee in his <hi>Epiſtle to Joachimus Roelandus, touching the China Root, about the end thereof</hi>) We think it not amiſs, neither our time ill ſpent, to give you his words at large, as we find them in the ſaid Epiſtle. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>can blame me for adminiſtring at a fit and convenient time that Medicament which I find commended by the prime</hi> Genoa <hi>Phyſitians, as divine, and as if it were ſome Deity; and which (with the greateſt promiſes that might be of the perpetual baniſhment of the Articular Diſeaſe) was ſome months ſince ſent unto Doctor</hi> Marſillus Colla, <hi>(Maſter of the Horſe to the Emperour, and one that for his many extraordinary parts, and endowments of mind, is worthy of more health then what at preſent he enjoyeth;) and now again alſo ſo brought unto</hi> Caeſar, <hi>that for the future we may moſt certainly conclude, and promiſe him, that he ſhal never more hence forward be troubled with the pain in his Joynts, if he pleaſe but to make uſe of this Medicaments Now in very truth the whole deſcription hereof is ſufficiently Empirical, and containeth in it nothing elſe but that at the firſt, and in the very beginning of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, a purgation is to be adminiſtred; and then afterwards, the Leaves of Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine (ſome call it Herb Ivy, or the little and low Oak) be cut in pieces whileſt they be yet green, if they may then be had, (but I for my own part would rather have it dry; and as in all other Herbs that have in them a faculty of drying, I prefer it before that which is green and newly gathered) and then boiled in white wine; and of this Decoction one Cup given in the morning, three hours before dinner: although in the mean time how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be added, that the longer before dinner the Decoction aforeſaid be taken and drunk, ſo much the more benefit is to be expected from it. In reference to the courſe of Dyet, whoſoever maketh uſe hereof muſt abſtain from all meats that are ſharp, ſour, and Salt; and the drinking of that Wine is preſcribed for ſixty daies, with this addition, that the diſtilled Liquor, or Water of the aforeſaid Herb, will add and confer much unto the ſtrength of the ſaid wine, (which ſeemeth unto me very ridiculous:) and that therefore for ſuch as are not pleaſed with the Decoction, they are to have the Water given them. As for any thing elſe, we find nothing in the whole ſheet ſent hither unto us, beſides a great and ſwelling Title, and a large Catalogue underneath of thoſe perſons who by the uſe thereof lived free from the Diſeaſe of the Joynts, for ſome years, and of ſuch as made uſe thereof when it was ſent unto them; in which Catalogue we find</hi> Cardinal Dorias <hi>to be the firſt, and foremoſt.</hi> Thus far <hi>Veſalius.</hi> From whoſe words it evidently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he himſelf gave not his ful conſent unto the praiſe and commendation of this Decoction. And very credible it is, that it did not benefit al that drank it: and yet notwithſtanding if we ſhall well weigh the virtues thereof (as they are before propounded) it wil from thence manifeſtly appear, that it is indeed a very excellent and precious Remedy in the Gout. But this <hi>Veſalius</hi> rightly tels us, and gives us notice of it, that the diſtilled Water cannot (in probability) add any thing unto the Decoction, in regard that the diſtilled Waters (as many falſly think) have not all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37365:68"/>the faculties and virtues of the ſimple; for all the parts thereof are not elevated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Alembick.</p>
                  <p>But now this Herb <hi>Ground-pine</hi> may be drawn into uſe many ſeveral waies.
<note place="margin">Ground-pine may he uſed many ways</note> Some take a pottle of <hi>Rheniſh Wine,</hi> the <hi>pureſt Water</hi> one pint, <hi>Honey</hi> of <hi>Roſes,</hi> the fourth or ſixth part of a quart. Boyl all upon the Coals in an Earthen Veſſel, and ſcum them: then add of <hi>Ground-Pine</hi> four handfuls, <hi>Germander</hi> two handfuls; <hi>Bears Ears</hi> or <hi>French Cowſlips,</hi> one handful; boyl them in a double Veſſel for three hours.</p>
                  <p>Others take <hi>of Groundpine gathered when it firſt beginneth to flouriſh, and well kept, o te handful; Wine three pints; boyl them in a double Veſſel five hours, and then ſtrain them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it were far better; if the Herb aforeſaid were tund up with the new Wine, and there let lie; that ſo in this manner a <hi>Chamaedryte</hi> Wine may be provided, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any boy ling at all.</p>
                  <p>And if any fear the Wine, he may in the like manner prepare an <hi>Hydromel,</hi> or a <hi>Chamaedeyte</hi> beer likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now the uſe of this Wine is to be continued (and ſo likewiſe of the Hydromel, or the Beer) for threeſcore daies, the Body being firſt well purged; and every day during the time one draught is to be taken in the morning.</p>
                  <p>And the like may alſo be made of the Eſſence of <hi>Ground-pine</hi> (as they cal it) and this muſt be made uſe of for many daies.</p>
                  <p>But it is not here my meaning that any ſhould be kept and held unto certain forms; but I would have thoſe Medicaments to be made up, and compounded,

                  <p>For <hi>Aetius</hi> doth here rightly admoniſh us, as touching Treacle, and the like hot Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, that they do not only not benefit thoſe that are of a more hot Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and temperament; but that they likewiſe oftentimes produce Reſolutions that prove incureable. But here indeed there are ſome that determine this to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood only of ſuch as are hot in the higheſt degree; becauſe that <hi>Galen</hi> alſo (in his <hi>fiſth Book of the preſentation of health,</hi>) expounding the words of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> (in which he forbiddeth the drinking of Wine unto thoſe that are hot,) writeth, that this is not intended of all abſolutely that are hot, but that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpake it of ſuch as were hot in the higheſt degree: but yet moſt certain it is, that great heed is here to be taken unto the diverſity of Bodies and temperaments; and that hot Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicantents are more conveniently alſo given in <hi>Autumn,</hi> then in the ſpring time; and therefore in Bodies that are more hot Succory is wont to be intermingſed with the Merſicament: and as touching <hi>Succory, Adrian Spigelius</hi> likewiſe writeth, that he had been taught by experience, how that in a hot Cauſe there was nothing more convenient then the Leaves of <hi>Wild Succory,</hi> gathered in the month of <hi>May,</hi> and dried in the ſhade, and then given one dram thereof, for the Doſe. And yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the <hi>Roote</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Succory</hi> are likewiſe very uſeful, if they be pulled up in the firſt beginning of the Spring; and the ſame may alſo as well as the Leaves be mingled together with thoſe other Medicaments that we mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

For (as <hi>Crato</hi> ſaith truly in his 25. <hi>Epiſt.</hi>) thoſe Sudorifiques (eſpeclally ſuch as are made of Guajacum Wood) if they be frequently adminiſtred, do very much conſume and waſt the Radical moiſture, which is not in the leaſt done by any of the afore cited Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which do only cleanſe the humors, and diſcuſs them by a moiſtneſs and dewineſs all the Body over in the morning, or by a gentle and light Sweat, or elſe alſo diſperſe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly. And beſides, ſuch Decoctions as theſe when they are taken in a great quantity do very much dry the Bowels, which of themſelves are for the moſt part over dry in thoſe that are afflicted with this Malady. Add to this, that thoſe Antipodagrick Medicaments before ſpoken of are moſt of them bitter; and thereupon they obtain a virtue and power of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away thoſe tartarous humors, and Cholerick Ichores that are collected about the Liver and Spleen; which virtue and faculty theſe Deoctions laſt mentioned do want; ſince they do only extenuate, dry, ſcatter the humors, and provoke Sweats.

And therefore at all times it there be any vitious Conſtitution in the Bowels, and a power generating that humor, we ought carefully to look to it, leſt that by the uſe of ſuch like Medicaments that aforeſaid power ſhould be augmented; as it is moſt certain, that that diſpoſition unto the Stone that is in the Reins may be greatly increaſed by hot and dry Medicaments unſouſonably given to break the Stone.

                  <head>What things they are that ſtrengthen the Joynts.</head>
                  <p>The third head of preventing the Gout conſiſteth in the ſtrengthening of the Joynts (as moſt Phyſitians tell us) that ſo they may not too readily and eaſily receive the humor flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them.
<note place="margin">The third Member of pre ſervae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Joynts: Whether it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or not?</note> But <hi>Carolus Piſo</hi> (as we likewiſe told you above) thinks that here in this thing much pains may be taken to little or no pupoſe, it being not within our power (would we never ſo fain) ſince that as he conceiveth, that weakneſs doth not conſiſt in any diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or nollowneſs, and looſneſs, but in the Natural conformation, and termination of the Veſſels into the extream Joynts. And although that even by this means alſo we may hinder and prevent that humor from flowing into the Joynts: yet he determineth that the ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ſo far from receiving any benefic from hence, that he may alſo by this means be brought into great peril and hazard of his life, the matter being tranſtated unto the Lungs, or ſome other noble Bowel. But in very good earneſt, it is not a thing to be ſleighted and nothing accounted of, that the humors chiefly flow into the Joynts, in regard that the Veſſels are terminated into them: and if the matter that was wont to flow into the Joynts be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the more noble Members, the ſick Perſon may then be caſt into great dangers; and as we told you above (among the Prognoſticks) it is a very il ſign, it the matter that was wont to flow unto the Joynts ſubſiſt and abide ſtil in the Body. And therefore we are not wholly to reſt and confide in this Remedy, or manner of preventing the Gout; without uſing the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our endeavor that thoſe vitious humors may not be generated in the Body; or if they be already bred there, that they may be frequently evacuated. And yet however this is alſo a certain Truth, that if the Joynts be weak and ill diſpoſed, the ſick Perſons are then the more frequently troubled with the fits, and not ſo eaſily freed from them. But now, in what this weakneſs of the Joynts eſpecially conſiſteth, we have ſhewn you above; and we ſhal likewiſe ſhew you further in the eighth Queſtion. And therfore if there be any thing in the Joynts, either left there after the Paroxyſm, or collected from ſome vitious Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is to be conſumed; and ſo the Joynt hath its own Conſtitution and Natural tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament reſtored; and thus it is ſaid to be ſtrengthened. And therefore the Medicaments that are here uſeful muſt be Aſtringent, and moderately hearing and drying. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch Medicaments as theſe are not to be adminiſtred, until al the pain and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be wholly vaniſhed, and that the hard knobs likewiſe diſappear. For whileſt theſe are in being, Aſtringents do more hurt than good, in regard that they drive the humor into the part affected, and there harden it.</p>
                  <p>But now for the ſtrengthening of the Joynts,
<note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ariſing from Grape Kernels, in the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of the Joynts.</note> and the conſuming of the Reliques of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that are in them, the uſe of Grape Kernels is by many commended, as that which affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth much benefit; touching which ſince that <hi>Antonius Donatus ab altomari</hi> hath written a whol Book, the Reader may conſult the ſame (if he pleaſe) for his further ſatisfaction. This only we ſhal deſire him to take notice of, that they are moſt convenienely uſed in the Vintage time, while they are new, and they muſt be ſuch as are taken out of Grapes that are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37365:70"/>throughly ripe: of the which ſeeing that in many places there is no great ſtore, other Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be made uſe of inſtead of them. Yet notwithſtanding there are ſome that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe uſe theſe Grape-ſtones dried; and they boyl them in red Wine and Water; and while they are boyling, they add to them Sage, Betony, Germander, Primroſe, and other ſuch like Herbs; as alſo Earth-worms.</p>
                  <p>Baths do likewiſe corroborate the Jovnts.
<note place="margin">Baths ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Joynts.</note> For although they be by ſome rejected, in regard that by their actual humidity and heat they attract the humors unto the feet; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs this inconvenience may eaſily be prevented, if Plants that heat and dry, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the feet, be boyled in the Water; ſuch as are Betony, Sage, Germander, Roſes, Cranes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bil, Heath, Oak Leaves, the Wood and betries of Juniper, and the Fruit of the Mountain or wild Pine-tree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Andemacus</hi> his waſhing of the Feet (which as he writeth, hath profited many that have made trial thereof) is in this manner:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Lye made of the Aſhes of the Beech, which is to be ſtrained three or four times; and then add thereto as much Wine, and Allum two ounces; and heat them at the fire.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Mugwort, Wormwood, Organy, and Camomile ſlowers, of each two handfuls: Allum, and Salt, of each one handful: Lye of the aſhes of Beech, as much as wil ſuffice; and boyl them together for a bath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo likewiſe for the ſtrengthening of the Joynts, very good and uſeful is a Bath of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper Wood, if the branches thereof be boyled in Chaly beat Water, until the Water be dyed and colored thereby, and hath even gotten the color of the Lye. And yet nevertheleſs there may alſo be added ſome ounces of Salt or Allum.</p>
                  <p>After the Bath the Joynts are to be anointed with the Oyl that is preſſed forth out of the Grape Ketnels, or the Oyl of Myrtle, or Roſes, or ſome other ſuch Oyl; touching which more anon.</p>
                  <p>But hot Baths are by many moſt eſpecially commended,
<note place="margin">Hot baths ſtrengthen the Joynts</note> although they be diſallowed of by others; of which we ſhal ſpeak further in the twelfth Queſtion. And ſo likewiſe the Baths that proceed from Sulphur, Salt, Nitre, Vitriol, (and partly alſo Baths of Allum Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) are very uſeful if they be made uſe of in a due and right manner. For if the Allum abound, the Baths are then to be made uſe of with great Caution, in regard that they ſhut the pores of the Body, and render it unfit to ſweat, a thing altogether neceſſary in ſuch as are troubled with the Gout; and if there remain any thing in the part affected which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale, and be diſperſed by inſenſible tranſpiration, they thruſt this forth unto the Nervous and Membranous parts, and ſo renew the pain; the ſame that happened to <hi>Fabricius</hi> in his 5. Century, Obſervat. 83. Among the reſt, the Hirſchergenſian, and Laudeccenſian hot Baths in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> the Caroline in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Badenſian in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the <hi>Martiate</hi> (now called the Wisbadenſian baths) the baths not far from <hi>Mentz,</hi> and thoſe likewiſe at <hi>Emſen</hi> upon the River <hi>Lanus,</hi> as alſo thoſe of <hi>Aquiſgran</hi> are al of them very uſeful for thoſe that have the Gout. But the Dirt or Clay of ſome certain Baths is chiefly to be made uſe of for the waſting away of the matter that ſticketh in theſe parts, and ſtrengtheneth the ſaid parts.</p>
                  <p>Where ſuch baths are wanting, Fomentations and artificial baths may be made. The Lotions or waſhings of Allum Water are very much commended; but yet it is far better that there be Salt and Sulphur added unto the Allum, that ſo if there be yet any of the matter left behind, it may be reſolved. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Flowers of Arabian Orrace, of Sage, Thyme, Cranesbil, of each one handful; boyl them in common Water, or (which is better) in Water wherein Iron hath been oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quenched: and to the ſtraining add Sulphur and Nitre, of each two ounces; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum one ounce: Let them be boyled again, and the parts fomented with the Decoction.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Germander, and Betony, of each one handful: Flowers of wild Roſes, Arabian Orrace, Bears Ears or French Cowſlips, the common Doves foot, of each two handfuls; white Vitriol one ounce: boyl them for a Fomentation or a Bath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the moſt ordinary and uſual Remedy (that is made uſe of by many) is the Unguent we mentioned alſo before,
<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguents and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſters</note> where we ſpake of the Cure; which is made of Salt torrefied or dried to a pouder (others are rather for the Salt of <hi>Juniper</hi>) and a ſufficient quantity of common Oyl, or Oyl of Roles, mingled into the form of an Unguent, with which the Joynts are to be wel rubbed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solenander</hi> maketh uſe of this Liniment after the Lotions.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:37365:70"/>
                  <p>Take <hi>Oyl Omphacine two ounces; Oyl of Maſtich one ounce; Salt dwed to a pouder two drams; Bole Armenick three drams; Dragons blood, and Hypeciſtis, Frankincenſe, and Maſtich, of each two drams and half. Let every one of theſe be firſt beaten into a fine Pouder by themſelves: and then let them be mingled together with the Oyls in a Mortar into the form of a Liniment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emplaſter <hi>Diachalciteos,</hi> or as ſome cal it, the Emplaſter <hi>Diapalma,</hi> laid on, is here likewiſe very uſeful. And this Emplaſter is fit and proper in al the joynts, whatſoever the humor be that floweth unto them. And <hi>Solenander</hi> in his 4. <hi>Sect. Confil.</hi> 25. writeth, That he knew divers, who before were wont very frequently to be troubled with fits of the Gout, that by the continual uſe of this Emplaſter, and by taking Purges now and then, were for the ſpace of five whol yeers freed from thoſe pains. And this Emplaſter it neither deſr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the part whereon it is laid, neither doth it cauſe any atch, or raiſe puſhes; nor is it at al offenſive, either in its ſmel or any other quality. Now it is fitted to the form of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. In the Feet ſhoes are made of thin Leather (but the Fox skin is more approved of) which within are to be covered over with the Emplaſter <hi>Diachalcitis,</hi> and ſo they are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the feet. The ſame Leather ſpread over with this Emplaſter may be applied unto the Knees, Hand-wriſts, and other parts. And Linnen Socks likewiſe waſhed in Wine with Water, then dryed, and drawn upon the Feet, are very uſeful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Eraſius</hi> commendeth the Sand ſtone (the Latin Phyſicians cal it <hi>Lapis Sabuli</hi>) if it be mingled with the Oyl of Myrtle, and Gentian Roots reduced into a Pouder, and laid on in the form of a Cataplaſm. But yet the ſame <hi>Eraſtus</hi> adviſeth us not to uſe it until it ſhal manifeſtly appear that there is no Excrement remaining in the Joynts, that may be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened into a Tophus. And therefore he perſwadeth us firſt of al (before we uſe it) to lay on once or twice the Cerote of Briony, deſctibed by <hi>Aetius</hi> (<hi>tetrab.</hi> 3. <hi>Serm.</hi> 4. <hi>chapt.</hi> 43.) that ſo there may be the leſs danger; and this <hi>Aetius</hi> very much commendeth.</p>
                  <p>But now as touching al manner of Topicks for the ſtrengthening of the feer, this is to be obſerved, that for ſuch as wil keep no orderly not regular courſe of Dyet, neither uſe conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient purgations, and other evacuations, theſe Topicks if they be adminiſtred, it wil be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any benefit at al, yea, oftentimes to their great detriment and hurt: but unto ſuch as live temperately, and uſe fit and proper Evacuations, they are adminiſtred with ſingular benefit and ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aetius</hi> (in the place alleadged,
<note place="margin">Cutting out of the Veins</note> Chap. 24) for the preventing of the Gout, commendeth alſo the cutting forth of the Veins that are from the ſuperior parts cartied down into the feet, done after the ſame manner as the <hi>Varices</hi> or crooked Veins in the Thighs are ſomtimes wont to be cut forth. But as <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente</hi> tels us rightly (in his <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Chirurgical Operations</hi>) the extraction and exciſion of the <hi>Varices</hi> is not only harſh and difficult; but that for the moſt part alſo it ſucceedeth unhappily, by teaſon of the blood flowing out. And moreover, from this cutting forth of the Veins the lower parts are ſoon brought into a waſting and withering condition. And beſides al this, although theſe Veins be cut forth; yet there is but very little benefit to be expected from thence. For if vitious Humors be heaped up in the Body, and be accuſtomed to flow unto the feet, their way and paſſage being ſhut up, they are carried unto ſome noble part, and there they may excite ſome other affect far more dangerous.</p>
                  <p>There may likewiſe, for the ſtrengthening of the Joynts, internal Medicaments be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred; to wit, thoſe which are appropriate unto them, as <hi>Germander, Ground-pine, or Herb Ivy, Betony, Primroſe, Sage, Roſemary,</hi> and others of this kind, as we mentioned them before.</p>
                  <p>And this is the way and means to prevent the Gout; as <hi>Rhaſes</hi> ſeems in few words to compriſe it, whilſt he thus writeth: <hi>If the perſon troubled with the Gout ſhall obſerve a good and orderly courſe of Dyet, and govorn himſelf as he ought in the fix things not Natural, and ſhall ſomtimes uſe Mithridate, or ſomthing elſe that may conſume all the ſuperflities, and ſhall likewiſe make uſe of Stipticks about the place of the Joynts, this perſon ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi>

               <p>IN regard that ſuch as are fick and diſeaſed deſire and expect from the Phyfitian,
<note place="margin">Comforting the patient in the gout</note> not Conſolation, but advice, and the beſt of his aſſiſtance; it may ſeem to be beſides the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37365:71"/>Office and buſineſs of the Phyſitian to write any thing touching Conſolation in the Gout: and indeed I ſhould not at al have publiſhed any thing of this Nature, had I not found the ſame date by that famous and moſt emment Man <hi>Johannes Crato,</hi> my fellow Ciuzen, and Phyſitian unto three Empetors, in his <hi>Conſil.</hi> collected by <hi>Scholtzius.</hi> Him therefore I now ſhal follow, and ſpeak ſomthing as touching the ſubject aforeſaid. For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes indeed Medicaments and helps of al ſorts are adminiſtred unto the ſick perſon, and yet nevertheleſs the Phyſitian doth not ſo obtain what he deſireth. And ſomtimes likewiſe the ſick party (either in telpect of the condition of his life, and imployment, or elſe alſo in regard of ſome other parts of his body) cannot ſo exactly as he ought obſerve what is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him by the Phyſitian; and therefore albeit the ſick perſon cannot then conceive any hopes of a perfect Cure, yet notwithſtanding he may have ſomthing to comfort himſelf withal.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Firſt of al therefore, The Gout preſerveth from many other Diſeaſes and Maladies, and it is a ſure ſign of the ſtrength of Nature; which driveth forth the vitious humors in the body, out of the high way, and common road (as I may term it) or (if you wil) the principal paſſages, unto the extream and more ignoble parts of the body; and on the contrary (as we likewiſe acquainted you before in the Prognoſticks) if Nature be weak, and ſink under the burden, as being no longer able to expel forth theſe humors, then Feavers and other dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſeaſes are wont to follow. And hence it is that Phyſitians (and ſome of them of great note) are of Opinion that the Gout many times maketh for the lengthening of the life; and that if it be ill cured it hafteneth on death. For Nature (as we ſaid erewhile) driveth the vitious humors unto the Joynts. But if (the body being not ſuſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or when there is no exact courſe of Dyet obſerved, or by reaſon of the long continuance of the diſeaſe, or elſe by reaſon of age) the ſtrength be weak, and the Phyſitian ſhal then buſie himſelf only in ſtrengthening of the Joyms, it may eaſily happen that the matter which Nature was wont to thruſt forth unto the Joynts, if it be ſtil retained in the body may be turned unto the principal parts, and ſo may excite dangerous Diſeaſes, yea, and haſten on death.</p>
               <p n="2">II. A man all the while he is troubled with the Gout is in no danger of his life (as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes he might be, to wit, but<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſly doth this. For whenas the pain in the Gout is moſt raging and incollerable, and that the Gout cannot by any thing be better prevented or mitigated, than by a frugal Dyet (and in this we find al Phyſitians to agree, and we have alſo a teſtimony of it from Experience it ſelf) which cauſeth that not only no matter may be ſupplied for the encreaſe of the ill humers; but it likewiſe beſt of al correcteth the diſtempers of the Bowels: and it is the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </q> and he ought to conſider likewiſe that that pleaſure which he taketh in a more free and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dyet, is not worth, neither wil it compenſate thoſe ſo great pains and wrackings that muſt be endured in the fits of the Gout. And although it ſeem indeed ſomwhat grievous to ſhun al feaſtings, and company-keeping, yet this muſt be thought of, That none of thoſe boon Companions can afterwards afford any the leaſt help in this Diſeaſe; but that (as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> hath it in his <hi>Tragopodagra,</hi> about the end thereof) they wil rather laugh at, and deride a man in his pain and miſery. Yea, moreover, whilſt that for fear of the Gout a man accuſtometh himſelf unto a good and orderly Dyer; he doth not only prevent the pains of the Gout, but he avoideth likewiſe many other Diſeaſes that proceed from the Errors in the Dyet; and a Man hereby oftentimes attaineth unto old Age. But as for ſuch as either wil not ſubmit themſelves unto the Rules of Dyer, or elſe by reaſon of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life and imployment cannot obſerve the ſame, let not theſe accuſe either the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, or the Phyſick, but let them blame themſelves; ſince that (as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Tract of Curing by letting blood, Chap. 7.) <hi>To preſcribe Medicaments</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>unto that party which neither can, nor will obſerve an orderly and due courſe of Dyet, is altogether in vain, and to no purpoſe.</hi> But now if a man obſerve a good Dyet, although he be not wholly freed from this Diſeale, he yet may then comfort himſelf in a good conſcience,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37365:71"/>and reſt himſelf contented in the will and good pleaſure of God. And hence it is, that <hi>Crato,</hi> in the <hi>place alleadg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when we have the Teſtimony of our own conſcience, that nothing hath been done by our own fault that might bring or increaſe the pain; it is then a very great Conſoftion, when we can perſwade our ſelves that we are altogether blameleſs; and ſo can cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeavour in a right manner to bear what is neceſſary and could not be avey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not to repine and minture againſt God.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have told you before that <hi>Arthritis</hi> is ſo called by the Greeks from <hi>Arthron</hi> (ſignifying a Joynt) and that therefore it very fitly agreeth with all the pains of the Joynts, (of which we have hitherto ſpoken,) but by the Barbarous and common Practitioners it is called alſo <hi>Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> but not ſo properly.

               <head>Queſt. 2. <hi>Whether every pain about the Joynts deſerve the name</hi> Arthritis.</head>
               <p>THere are indeed ſome of this Opinion, that every pain that happeneth about the Joynts is to be called <hi>Arthritis;</hi> ſince that if there be any other ſuch like pains, they are no where expreſſed by any of the Phyſitians; neither hath any of them written of any pain of the Joynts that is not Arthritick. And although we may meet with ſome kind of ſeeming difference, either according to the greatneſs, or according to the duration of them (a ſhorter or a longer time) they conceive that this difference doth not at all vary the ſpecies or kind thereof.</p>
               <p>But I think that <hi>Galen</hi> (in the third Section, Aphoriſm 15. and 16) writeth moſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that if the filthineſs be ſo great that it may dry up and conſume the moiſture of the Joynts, it may then indeed cauſe a difficulty of the motion, by reaſon of the drineſs in the Joynts, and that it may haply cauſe pain likewiſe; yet nevertheleſs it never produceth that affection which is called <hi>Arthritis;</hi> unleſs any one be minded to call all pains whatſoever of the Joynts by this name. For <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf, for ſuch as by the over-eating of the bitter Vetch <hi>Orobus</hi> and other Pulſe had contracted theſe kind of pains, he doth not call theſe Perſons Arthritick, but Gonalgick Perſons. And therefore although we ſcarcely find any Anthor handling all ſuch pains as theſe in any one place, yet nevertheleſs we find them created of and mention made of them here and there, in ſeveral places of the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. For it very frequently ſo happeneth that vitious humors heaped up in the Body, may be by a Feaver (or elſe alſo without a Feaver) thruſt forth into the Joynts, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Knees, and may there occaſion pains which may oftentimes continue a long while; and ſuch no doubt were thoſe mentioned by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the place afore alleadged; which if not alwaies, yet when the ſick Perſon deſireth to move his Feet, they then excite Pain; unto which notwithſtanding (to ſpeak properly) the name <hi>Arthritis</hi> properly ſo called, doth not ſuit not agree. So in ſuch as have Dropſies and ſuch as are Cachectick, or of an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither doth the humor then flow into the part affected by and thorow the Veins, but it by little &amp; little deſcendeth thereinto by the Pores in the Abdomen. And if we exactly weigh the matter, we ſhal find that ſuch like humors as theſe do not ſeiz upon the very parts themſelves that conſtitute and knit the Joynt together; but that rather a humor from without is poured forth and floweth round about theſe parts, and ſticketh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>And therfore the <hi>Arthritis</hi> properly and in ſpecial ſo called, is only that pain of the Joynts, when the peculiar humor deſcribed above, bred in the Bowels of the lower Belly, and heaped up in the Veins and Arteries, by them ſuddenly floweth into the Joynts, and inſinuateth it ſelf more eſpecially into the ſenſible and tender parts about the Joynts, and there partly by twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and partly by diſtending cauſeth pain.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MAny indeed there are of this Opinion, that the humor the Cauſe of <hi>Arthritis</hi> doth conſiſt eſpecially in that Cavity or hollow ſpace that is betw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And for this their Opation they firſt of all alleadg that which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writeth (in Sect. 6. Aphoriſm 49.) that the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is not ended before the fourtieth day, and that the humors that have flown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the part affected are not ſooner diſcuſſed as being ſuch as ſtick in a part deſtitute of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37365:73"/>heat; whereas if they conſiſted in fleſhy parts, and ſuch as have many Veins and Arteries, they might eaſily be reſolved. And ſecondly, they go about to prove it by this, becauſe that from the afflux of the humors into the Cavities of the Joynt the bones are made to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves one from the other, and ſo by diſtending the Tendons and Membranes they cauſe the pain. Thirdly, becauſe that by the motion of the joynt the pain is encreaſed. Fourthly, becauſe that a pain is firſt of al perceived in the bottom of the part affected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever the external parts begin to ſwel; but that after wards when the humors have gotten themſelves a way unto the outward parts, the external parts are then lifted up into a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>But the contrary Opinion, which determineth that the fluxion is firſt of al made into the very parts incumbent upon the joynt (from whence they may haply ſomtimes, but this is very rare, ſweat through into the Cavity or ſpace of the joynt) is altogether more agreeable unto the Truth: and this we are taught firſt of al by the very breeding it ſelf of the <hi>Arthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> For ſince that the afflux of the humor generating the Arthritis is by thoſe Veſſeis that carry along the Aliment unto the parts (as we ſhal afterwards prove) it is neceſſary that the vitious humor that inſinuateth it ſelf into the joynt ſhould firſt of al flow into the parts ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the joynts, and keeping them cloſe together; and that from hence (if there be any great ſtore thereof) it may inſinuate it ſelf into the Cavity of the joynt. Secondly, the bones are ſo knit together by the ſtrongeſt Ligaments, that there is hardly any ſpace at all left into which the matter may inſinuate it ſelf. Thirdly, The Ligaments are very thick and ſolid, ſo that they wil not eaſily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dmit of the humors flowing in unto them; and much leſs wil they permit them firſt of al to flow into the very Cavity of the joynt. Fourthly, if the matter ſhould flow into the very Cavity, and the bones thereupon divide themſelves the one from the other, the Membranes would then be made longer; which yet we ſee is never done. Fiftly, in the knotty <hi>Arthritis,</hi> thoſe hard knobs that are ſomtimes taken out of the joynts, are not found in the ſpace between the bones, but about the Ligaments, and the parts encompaſſing the joynt. Sixtly, if the humor ſhould firſt of al flow into the very joynt it ſelf, and that it ſhould from hence be communicated unto the external parts, there would then be excited either no pain at al, or ſuch as would ſcarcely be perceived; in regard that the heads of the bones (in al that ſpace in the which they are knit the one to the other) are not covered with any <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> but only with a Cartilage; and there is no Membrane or Nerve at al in that place. Seventhly, the tumor or ſwelling that ſeizeth upon the external parts, and from the juncture of the joynt is ſomtimes extended far abroad unto the parts lying neer unto it, it ſufficiently teacheth us that the humor the cauſe of the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> is not contained in the very joynt it ſelf, but in the parts about the joynt. And laſtly, if the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor ſhould be contained in the very Cavity between the bones, it could not be (which yet we ſee that it often ſo cometh to paſs) that cooling and repelling Medicaments ſhould forthwith drive back the humor from the place affected into the Veſſels, and from hence into other places.</p>
               <p>And as for whatſoever they alleadg and bring for the contrary Opinion, it may be eaſily anſwered. For firſt of al, That the humors in <hi>Arthritis</hi> are oftentimes long ere they can be diſcuſſed, the cauſe is, not that the humors are contained in the Cavity between the bones; but becauſe they ſtick in places void of blood, and therefore having but little heat in them; and the humor it ſelf likewiſe is ſomwhat unfit to be perfectly diſcuſſed. Neither yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs is this alwaies true; for oftentimes alſo the matter is diſperſed and ſcattered in a very ſhort ſpace of time, to wit, when there is not much thereof, when it is thin, when the Part is cheriſhed with heat, and the matter not thickned by unfit To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks.</p>
               <p>And moreover, the pain is not therefore excited becauſe the Joynts are ſtretched forth in length, and made longer, and ſo are ſeparated one from the other, but becauſe that a ſharp humor flowing into the Membranous parts doth diſtend, and twinge them. And thirdly, although the pain be more excited while the joynt is moved; yet this happeneth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe that the humor is contained in the very joynt (for as we told you but even now, this is void of ſenſe) but becauſe the Membranous parts about the joynt, being before preternaturally diſtended by the humor, are now more ſtretched forth. Neither laſtly doth that prove that the humor doth firſt of al fal forth into the ſpace of the joynt, becauſe that the pain, when the Diſeaſe firſt ſeizeth the party, is perceived to lie deep, before the external parts ſwel up, which when it happeneth the pain is mitigated. It is true indeed that theſe things do often ſo come to paſs, and that in the beginning there is very little or no ſwelling appearing, and that yet in the mean time the pain rageth in the top of the part affected, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37365:74"/>there becometh moſt grievous; which is afterwards aſſwaged when the external parts ſwel up.

                  </gap>h from hence, that the whol vitions humor doth firſt of all by the extremities of the Veſſels flow unto the Nervous and Membranous parts about the Joynts, and greatly afflict them; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when part of the humor is likewiſe diſtributed into the fleſhy parts, the pain becometh more mild and moderate; when the humor is diſtributed into many places, it doth then act leſs powerfully; and thoſe parts are made more looſe and ſo are diſtended with leſs pain than otherwiſe: like as we ſee the very ſame to be in the pain of the Teeth, which at firſt is very great and intollerable, when all the humor floweth into the Teeth, and theſe Nerves inſerted into them; but afterwards when part of this humor is diſtributed into the Jaw lying neer, as likewiſe the Gums, then the pain is mitigated. But yet in the mean time (as we ſaid before) we deny not this that at length alſo even ſome of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may poſſibly ſweat through into the very Cavity of the Joynt, if the afflux continue long. Neither do the two laſt Aphoriſms of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> make at all againſt our Opinion; where (in the ſixth Section) he thus writeth: <hi>Thoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that have been long conflicting with the pain of the Hips, if in theſe the top of the Thigh fall out of the Hip-Bone, and then return and fall in again, theſe have in that place a Mucous and ſnotty flegm collected. And again, they that by being vexed with a long continued Sciatica pain have the top of their Thigh fallen out of the Hip, in theſe the Thigh waſteth away, and unleſs they be burnt, they halt and become lame.</hi> For that Joynt doth not therefore fall forth, becauſe that the Bone is thruſt out of its place by the humor fallen into the Cavity: but (as <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comm. upon the Aphoriſms teacheth us) becauſe the bonds of the Articulation being ſoaked and moiſtened by the flegmatick humor are thereby rendred more looſe.</p>
               <p>But now what thoſe parts are about the Joynt that receive and entertain the humor that floweth unto them, neither do they al fully agree in their Opinions as touching this. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pivaccius</hi> and ſome others with him determine that this afflux is made only unto the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that in the <hi>Arthritis</hi> the Ligaments are filled ful, but not ſo the Nerves and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons; ſince that if theſe parts were filled there would then be Convulſions: for theſe parts come to be affected only by the conſent of the Ligaments, whiles that they are preſſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by theſe Ligaments being filled with the humor. But the Ligaments are ſo hard and ſolid, that it is not credible that theſe eſpecially ſhould receive the humor flowing unto them, and be repleniſhed thereby. And the pain is not therefore excited, becauſe that only the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and Membranous parts are preſſed together by the Ligaments preternaturally filled with the humor. For if this were the Cauſe, the pain could not poſſibly be ſo fierce and bitter; but becauſe that a ſharp and gnawing humor doth prick and twinge the tender and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts. For as in other parts the Membranous <hi>Perioſtia,</hi> and Nerves, are the ſubject of the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But now that there is no Convulſion excited, we have already ſhewn you the reaſon thereof above, to wit, becauſe that the parts that are by Nature aſſigned for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not affected, but ſuch only as are appointed for ſenſe, as the Membranes, or the Nerves likewiſe themſelves (ſuch of them as are not deſtined unto motion) according to the Membranes.</p>

For in the Feaver that accompanieth the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> the Fewel of the Feaver is not in the part affected (that is to ſay, the part that laboreth under the <hi>Arthritis</hi>) but it is in the great Veſſels.

               </head>
               <p>VVE have told you indeed that the nigheſt and moſt immediate Cauſe of <hi>Arthritis,</hi> is the ſolution of continuity in thoſe parts that are about the Joynts, proceeding from a humor that hath flown into them, whiles it either diſtendeth thoſe parts, or elſe pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and launceth them; or elſe doth both theſe. And yet notwithſtanding as touching this thing, the Phyſitians do not a little differ among themſelves; and as for the nigheſt cauſe exciting the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> ſome of them determine one thing, and ſome another. Which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement among Phyſitians, I conceive hath not been the leaſt Cauſe why the <hi>Arthritis</hi> hath oftentimes been ſo unhappily and unſucceſsfully cured. For when the Cauſe of a Diſeaſe is not ſufficiently agreed upon, it is not poſſible that the Cure ſhould ever be rightly performed.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Whether a bare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper may be the Cauſe of</hi> Arhritis?</note> there are ſome likewiſe that do indeed reckon up a naked and bare diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per among the Cauſes of <hi>Arthritis,</hi> and this is alſo aſſerted by <hi>Coſtaeus</hi> (in his third Book upon <hi>Avicen. Fen.</hi> 22. <hi>tractate</hi> 2. Chap. 5.) for this reaſon, becauſe that ſomtimes there is a pain felt, without any ſwelling at all, which is wont to be joyned unto a diſtemper with matter. But a bare diſtemper (let it be even what it wil) is not the nigheſt cauſe of this Affect, ſeeing that the diſtemper that ſomtimes exciteth ſo long a continuing pain, cannot poſſibly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37365:75"/>ſubſiſt alone; neither can it likewiſe be the cauſe of ſo great and grievous a pain. And moreover, the very humor it ſelf (oftentimes manifeſt enough) doth ſufficiently ſhew that beſides the diſtemper there is likew iſe preſent an afflux of the humors.</p>
               <p>And although in the beginning there is oftentimes no ſwelling at al that appeareth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, yet neither doth this ſufficiently evince that there is therefore no humor within. Like as in the Pleurifie, the Toothach, and the many other pains of other parts, the humor lying hid within diſcovereth it ſelf by pain alone, but by no ſwelling at all. Moreover, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ſweating Medicaments are of ſingular uſe in the curing and prevention of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; which yet are no waies neceſſary in a pure diſtemper.</p>
               <p>And although that <hi>Paraeus</hi> relateth a Hiſtory of his own Diſeaſe, by which he would prove that a naked and bare diſtemper may produce the <hi>Arthritis;</hi> yet this ſtory of his doth not ſufficiently prove that there was no afflux at al of the humors preſent; ſince that the qualities of the external Air may excite an afflux of the humors. <hi>Petrus Salius Diverſus</hi> indeed (in his Tract of the affect. of the parts) maketh mention of an <hi>Iſchias</hi> or <hi>Arthritis</hi> from drineſs; the cauſe whereof was neither known to <hi>Galen,</hi> nor yet unto any of thoſe that came after him: but <hi>Hippocrates</hi> only knew it, as appeareth in his B. of the internal Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. But (as he writeth) we are not by drineſs to underſtand any dry diſtemper of the parts conſtituting the joynt it ſelf (to wit, of the bones, ligaments, and tendons) but a waſting and conſumption of its glutinous humidity, by which it is naturally nouriſhed, and whereby the joynt it ſelf is oyled as it were, and made the more fit for motion. For if upon any occaſion whatſoever it ſo happen that this humidity be wholly dried up, then the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the joynt is hindered; and a difficulty of the motion, and withal a pain ſucceedeth. And he tels us, that this Affect, if it be in the joynt of the Hip, it is then by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> called the <hi>Iſchiadick</hi> or <hi>Sciatick</hi> pain; but that he himſelf had likewiſe taken notice that it might be bred in any other joynt whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Galen</hi> was not ignorant of this Affect; only he denieth it to be the true <hi>Arthritis;</hi> and he tels us that it was only a certain kind of Impediment in the motion, whilſt that in the third Section, and 16. Aphoriſm, he thus expreſsly writeth: If immoderate drineſſes conſume the humidity of the joynts, it then indeed cauſeth a certain difficult motion by reaſon of the drineſs; and perhaps likewiſe now and then a pain. But that this paſſion (which they cal <hi>Arthritis</hi>) is in no wiſe cauſed, unleſs any one be diſpoſed to cal al the pains whatſoever of the joynts by the name of <hi>Arthritis.</hi> And moreover (I ſpeak it without detracting in the leaſt from the worth of men ſo eminent) be it ſo indeed, that ſuch a pain and impediment of the motion may proceed from drineſs: yet I much doubt of this, Whether or no this pain be cauſed only by the waſting of that humidity whereby the heads of the bones are as it were anointed and oyled. For in the whol ſpace in the which they are joyned together, the bones are not covered with any <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> and thereupon they are wholly void of ſenſe; and therefore in this place pain cannot be excited. But it ſeemeth to be more agreeable to truth (if there be any impediment of the motion, or any pain excited in the joynts by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of drineſs) that this happeneth by reaſon of the over drying of the Tendons, the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Muſcles and Ligaments; by means of which the Members are rendered unfit for motion: and if it be ſo that they ought to be moved, there is a neceſſity of their being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently extended; and this violent ſtretching forth breedeth a pain.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that a naked and bare diſtemper cannot cauſe the <hi>Arthritis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whether a windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may cauſe the Arthritis?</note> it remaineth that we make enquiry from what matter it may be excited. There are ſome indeed (as <hi>Guainerius,</hi> and <hi>Matthaeus</hi>) that make mention of windineſs, and of the degrees the of. But a windineſs cannot poſſibly excite ſo great a pain, and oftentimes alſo of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in theſe parts; unleſs by windineſs any one be minded to underſtand the ſpirit; touching which we ſhall ſpeak more hereafter. And although the pain be oftentimes movable, and flitting from place to place; yet this is not from any windineſs, but from the humor, which is alſo moſt apt and fit for motion.</p>
               <p>There are ſome likewiſe that unto <hi>Arthritis</hi> refer that Affect which by the Arabians is called <hi>Nakir;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nakir <hi>what kind of Affect it is.</hi>
                  </note> which <hi>Albucaſis</hi> (in his ſecond B. and 93. Chap.) thus deſcribeth: <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in this Country of ours a certain ſickneſs or Diſeaſe which they call</hi> Nakir; <hi>and it is a pain that happeneth in ſome certain Members, and afterwards is changed from one Member to another: and of this diſeaſe I once ſaw ſuch an Example as this that I ſhal now relate. I was upon a time called unto a certain woman being ſick and weak in a Village not far from me. She uncovered her Arm, where I beheld a ſmal Inflation in the Vein of the Arm; and about an hour after I ſaw this Inflation to proceed forward with great ſpeed (like as a worm creepeth) and aſcending upwards unto the Shoulder much ſooner than
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37365:75"/>could poſſibly be imagined: and it was moved upwards like as Quick-ſilver is moved when it runs from place to place. The pain therefore departed out of the place where it was at firſt, and fixeth it ſelf in the Shoulder. And afterwards, as ſhe her ſelf told me, it rowled up and down throughout the whole Body; even as I my ſelf might very eaſily diſcover it to be ſo. I therefore greatly admired the ſwiftneſs of its motion from Member to Member; for indeed I had never until now ſeen any ſuch kind of Diſeaſe as I ſaw in this Woman. Indeed I have ſeen many that have felt the pain changing and going from one member to another, but not after this manner, or with this celerity; neither could I here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture any other cauſe then this to wit, that the Woman was quite ſpent, and diſpirited by the heat of the Sun, and her hard labor and pains-taking, (ſuch as they are wont to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go that live in villages) her Body being very dry, and her Veins uncovered. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon therefore that windineſs appeareth to be changed even ſenſibly; and of neceſſity it is that it cannot appear after this manner in ſuch as live idle and delicate lives, and in moiſt Bodies, and where the Veins are kept covered. And therefore whenſoever thou attempteſt the curing hereof, and the Patient Feel that pain, then if it be the ſame, it appeareth to the Eyes, as we ſaid before. Then haſten and bind both upon it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; and cut upon it, till the Windineſs that is pent up and kept in hath a vent and paſſage made for it to go forth; and Cauterize the place. But if it be ſo that thou canſt not ſee the place that is affected, and the pain, then Cure it with the excuſſion of the Body, and ſome kind of Remedy that expelleth windineſſes, and extenuateth them. And for this purpoſe, very neceſſary and uſeful are the</hi> Foetid <hi>Pills, the Pills</hi> de Sagapeno, <hi>and the like.</hi> Thus far <hi>Albucaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But this Diſeaſe is not <hi>Arthritis.</hi> For neither is it only about the Joynts, but it ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from a Windineſs, or furious ſpirit poured forth out of the Veſſels, and running to and fro throughout all the external parts of the Body. There are ſome who think that this motion of windineſſes, and ſpirits, is made in the Veins themſelves. And true indeed it is, that oftentimes in the Veſſels and Bowels ſuch like windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes do run up and down with great violence and ruſhing; like as <hi>Antonius Beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venius</hi> (in his Tract of <hi>hidden Diſeaſes,</hi> and <hi>the Cure of the Cauſes, Chap.</hi> 81.) Relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Ludovicus Nicolinus</hi> was ſo affected with a winde ruſhing violently into his Bowels and Stomack, that not only his Bowels and Breaſt, but his ſhoulder-blades were likewiſe extended with an incredible pain; and he was likewiſe forely troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a great and miſerable ſtreightneſs of breathing; whereupon alſo he died the third day. But in that Hiſtory of <hi>Albucaſis,</hi> it is probable, that the Flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and windy ſpirit that he ſpeaketh of was poured forth of the Veſſels into the very ſuperficies and outſide of the Body. For ſeeing that the motion there ſpoken of was Joyned with a great pain, that ſpirit could not be contained only in the Veſſels, as being ſuch that are deſtitute and void of all ſenſe.</p>
               <p>And ſome there are who think (and this rightly enough) that this Affect, (if it be not one and the ſame, yet that it) is very neer of kin unto that deſcribed by <hi>Wierus,</hi> in a peculiar Tract, (in a Book he wrote in the <hi>German Tongue,</hi> touching <hi>unknown Diſeaſes:</hi>) of which likewiſe <hi>Henricus</hi> a <hi>Bra,</hi> wrote an Epiſtle to <hi>Petrus Foreſtus;</hi> which Epiſtle is annexed unto the <hi>obſervations</hi> of <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> in his <hi>twentyeth B.</hi> of <hi>Obſervations.</hi> Thoſe of our times do for the moſt part refer them to inchantment; and they tel us I know not what of Elves and Fayries that (as they conceive) breed thoſe pains; when yet notwithſtanding theſe and ſuch like of flitting pains that run up and down in the Body may alſo have their Natural Cauſes, and they may have their Original from a certain ſharp Flatulency, or a ſharp whey bred out of a Humor almoſt Scorbutick, and roving up and down the Body by the Membranous parts and Muſcles.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37365:76"/>his Husbandry, and very ſleepy as he was, laid himſelf down upon the Ground, and there he ſlept for ſome certain hours; at length awaking, in his left hand, about the wriſt, he felt an intollerable pain, which at length ſeized his whole Arm, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he was not able to move his Hand, or ſo much as to ſtir his ſingers, which were now grown ſtiff as it were: and ſoon after he was troubled with the ſame pain about the Foot, unto which was added likewiſe a very ſtrong and violent Feaver, Of all which not withſtanding by purging and altering Medicaments, and by the adminiſtring of Topicks, he was cured in ſeven daies times, or leſs. Where he likewiſe maketh mention of another, who very drunk as he was lying all night in his Garden upon the cold ground, when he awoke was immediatly taken with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent feaver, and moſt intollerable pains, of which in a very ſhort time he died. But as it ſeems to me, thoſe affects were not properly Arthritick, but rather acute feavers contracted from Vapours exhaling out of the Earth, which they both of them received by ſleeping thereon; in which feavers Nature thruſt forth part of the vitious Humor unto the extream parts of the Body; and ſo from this Humor there were not only pains excited in the Joynts, but alſo in the whole Arm, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Muſcles being there affected: and ſo great was the pravity of this Humor, that it likewiſe ſnatcht away one of theſe two by a ſudden Death.</p>

And as for the pain, it is ſomtimes indeed very troubleſom, but yet not ſo but that it may well be born; but then at other times (according to the Humor, the cauſe thereof) it is moſt ſharp and intollerable. And then again, this pain is ſomtimes ſoon gone and vaniſhed, but that continueth a long while. But oftentimes alſo divers evil Symptoms do follow, as an extraordinary great heat and burning in the place affected. But ſomtimes again, either there is preſent no heat at all, or on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there is a coldneſs that greatly troubleth the party; ſome of theſe perſons being offended by the Air when it is over hot, and others by an Air too cool. The way and courſe of Curing is ſomtimes alſo very var<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then again, ſome of theſe pains are appeaſed by the Evacuation of the Blood, ſome by the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging forth of Flegm, a third ſort from the emptying forth of the Choler, and the laſt kind of them by the Evacuation of Melancholly are very much mitigated and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied. All which ſeemeth to denote thus much unto us, that the cauſe of the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is ſomtimes hot, and now and then cold and ſomtimes, the matter thereof very various and different.</p>
               <p>But theſe Reaſons do not ſufficiently prove that which they ought. For although that (according to the various treaſuring up of Humors) divers kinds of Humors may flow unto the part affected; yet theſe are not the prime and principal cauſe of the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> but together with the <hi>Serum,</hi> or Whey, they are foreibly carryed unto the part affe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But as for Choler, there are ſome who upon very good ground will have the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thritis</hi> to proceed from it alſo, and not only from the flegm; and this they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to prove even by thoſe very ſigns that appear in the <hi>Arthritis.</hi> For the pain is for the moſt part extream ſharp and violent; and not unlike unto that pain that is pricking and ſhooting; and the Diet that went before was dry and hot; or at leaſt, very much tending thereunto: the excerciſes alſo were over-violent; and the habit of the Body thin and ſpare. And the very truth is, that this is not indeed to be denied, that thoſe things do ſomtimes befal the ſick perſons; and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo the pain is ſo ſharp, that it cannot poſſibly by any meanes be referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Crude Humor Flegm, but argueth rather a hot Humor. But now a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be here made, whether or no every preternatural hot Humor may be called Choler; and we think that we may well deny this to be a truth: and we determine with <hi>Carolus Piſo,</hi> that there may be a Serous or Wheyiſh Cacochymy, (although he doth not rightly explain it) and that there may likewiſe be a Serous Humor that may be moſt hot; and that under it there may alſo be comprehended thoſe ſharp <hi>Ichores,</hi> (of which we ſind <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> making mention, and of which we ſhal have occaſion to ſpeak more anon) or if you had rather ſpeak as do the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, that Tartarous Salt, or the ſpirits of Tartarous Salts.

And in this indeed his Opinion is right and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the truth, that of one Diſeaſe there is but one only cauſe; but in this he is very much miſtaken, when he tels us that this Humor is cold; ſince that almoſt all the Symptoms that befal Arthritick perſons teach us the Contrary; to wit, that moſt acute and ſharp pain, burning heat, ſudden motion, and the reſt of them. For although when this Humor firſt beginneth to be moved there may ariſe ſome kind of coldneſs, by which the whole Body may be extreamly Chilled and made to ſhake; yet notwithſtanding this is no ſure and certain ſign of a cold matter; ſince that even the hot Humors alſo (when they are moved through thoſe parts that have their fenſe and feeling) may by little and little produce a coldneſs, or chilneſs, and horrour; as it is alſo very manifeſtly to be ſeen in Cholerick Feavers. And then Secondly, he erreth likewiſe in this, that he accounteth flegm and the Serous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor for all one Humor; as likewiſe in this, that he will have the Serous Humor to be ſimply a cold Humor. For albeit that in the Serous Humors there are many parts that are wateriſh; yet there are alſo many parts therein that are ſharp and Salt, by which it differeth from ſimple and pure Water.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſeemeth to have taken this his Opinion from <hi>Galen,</hi> (in his <hi>tenth Book of the Compoſit. of Medicaments according to the place,</hi> and 2 <hi>Chap.</hi>) where he writeth, that the Humor which exciteth the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is fomtimes indeed the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37365:77"/>blood, but for the greateſt part a Flegmatick Humor, or mixt Humor, partly Flegmatick and partly Cholerick, or likewiſe of the blood mingled together with thoſe aforeſaid. Or if any one would ſpeak more exactly as concerning it, he may ſay that it is not a flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick humor, but that the Humor which moſt an end is called Crude and indigeſted, and is for the moſt part predominant about the Joynts, is now and then very thick, and like unto the thicker ſort of <hi>Pus:</hi> but when it hath for a while continued in the joynts, it is then ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not only more thick, but alſo viſcid and clammy.</p>
               <p>There are very many other Phyſitians that in this follow the Opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius;</hi> and they account the Flegmatick, Cold, Crude, and Serous Humor, for one and the ſame; and withal they teach us that it is the cauſe of <hi>Arthritis.</hi> But in this they are al of them miſtaken; ſeeing that neither can ſo ſharp a pain proceed from ſuch a cold and crude humor; and becauſe that the <hi>Arthritis</hi> invadeth the ſick perſon ſuddenly; and then oftentimes lieth hid again for a while, and is removed into another place; for the doing of which the thick and dul flegmatick humor, and that humor likewiſe that ſo neerly relem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth thick <hi>Pus,</hi> is altogether unfit. And moreover, ſeeing that even in the very beginning (when there is no ſwelling as yet appearing) the pain is moſt vehement and exquiſite, this is ſufficient to ſhew that it is cauſed by a humor both ſubtil and ſharp (and this alſo penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the moſt ſtreight and narrow paſſages, and pricking the Membranes) and that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not from any thick and cold humor.

But that Affect at this time was not indeed the Gout truly and properly ſo called, but only an <hi>Oedematous</hi> tumor, with the which the feet (by reaſon of a long and laſting afflux of the humors) were much troubled.

                  <hi>Ambroſe Parry</hi> (in his 17. <hi>B.</hi> and 2. <hi>Chapter</hi>) whenas he himſelf likewiſe took notice that the humor which generateth the <hi>Arthritis</hi> was a nature altogether different from thoſe that are the Authors of the <hi>Phlegmone, Oedema, Eryſipelas,</hi> or <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> he for his part determineth, that the nature of this humor was neither better nor worſe, but the very ſame with that from whence the Plague, French Pox, or the Epilepſie have their Original; and this he endeavoreth to prove: 1. Becauſe this humor never cometh to a ſuppuration, as do all the reſt of the humors. 2. Becauſe that it produceth pains far more ſharp and bitter than the other humors; inſomuch that the ſick Perſons often complain that they feel the part affected to burn as they think. 3. Becauſe that it is changed into hard knobs or knots, which doth not happen unto any other of the humors. 4. becauſe that it wil very hardly give place or remove for any Remedies whatſoever; but is rather more ſtird up, exaſperated, and enraged by them; ſo that the Patients are ready to tell us, that it is far better with them when they are without any remedies at all than when they have them applied. 5. Becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf (in his <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Theriaca</hi> to <hi>Piſo, Chap.</hi> 15.) ſaith that Treacle is very uſeful for all Arthritick Perſons whatſoever, as that (in <hi>Paraeus</hi> his Opinion) which dulleth and blunteth the malignity of the humor. In this indeed <hi>Paraeus</hi> his Opinion is right, that the common ordinary humors (Choler, Flegm, and Melancholly) do not produce the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thritis,</hi> but that the humor which is the Cauſe of the <hi>Arthritis</hi> doth obtain and hath in it ſomwhat that is proper and peculiar, and this is ſufficiently proved by the Reaſons above alleadged by him: but indeed there is no need at all that we ſhould here have recourſe unto any peculiar Malignity, and occult quality; neither do the Reaſons alleadged prove it. For there appeareth here nothing that is Malignant; but the vehemency of the pain procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the Acrimony of the humor; the which happeneth likewiſe ſomtimes in the pain of the Teeth, Ears, and other parts. And although that <hi>Galen</hi> commend Treacle as good againſt the <hi>Arthritis;</hi> yet this doth not at all argue, nor make that it ſhould ſubdue the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the humor, but rather that it ſhould conſume the vitious humors; and many other Medicaments of this nature are alſo before propounded, in the Cure of the <hi>Arthritis.</hi> But yet in the mean time we do not deny this, that the humor (which is the cauſe of the <hi>Arthritis</hi>) may ſomtimes likewiſe obtain a peculiar Malignity; like as we ſee it to be in the Scurvy, and the <hi>Polonian Plica.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding we ſay, that it doth not produce the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> as it is a Malignant humor, but as it hath that diſpoſition which other humors alſo (exciting the <hi>Arthrtitis</hi>) do obtain; that yet are altogether void of any the leaſt Malignity.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37365:78"/>diſeaſe is a Mineral liquor, or a ſowr juyce, ſuch as are, Allum, Vitriol, Vinegar, Barberries, Acacia, and the like; for ſeeing that theſe Salts are contrary and oppoſite unto the <hi>Synovia,</hi> if they be generated in any man, and mingled together with the <hi>Synovia,</hi> they then cauſe the <hi>Synovia</hi> to boyl over: and then he afterwards tels us ſtrange and wonderful things touching the influence of Heaven (which here I ſcarcely think worth the relating) as Irkewiſe thoſe things which he hath in his 2.

In his <hi>Paramirum</hi> he referreth this Diſeaſe to Mercury precipitate: But in his B. of Tartarous Diſeaſes, Chap. 19. he referreth it unto Tartar. <hi>Petrus Severinus</hi> (in his <hi>Idea Medica, cap.</hi> 12.) teacheth us, that the excited Roots of theſe Podagrick Affects, if they have their ſeat in the blood, they boyl up with hear, and ſend ſpiritual and vaporous Tinctures unto the Domeſtick places; and that the Matrixes of the Roots having there gotten fruit, do by a dolorous calamity of the Symptoms abſolve the revolutions of the Predeſtinations. But the truth is, the differences of the pain (that I may in plain and eaſieterms ſhew you what he by an affected pomp of words obſcureth) do all of them proceed from a diverſity of the Salts, of which ſome are more, and ſome leſs ſharp and biting: but that theſe ſpiritual and vaporous Tinctures are received by their Matrixes, (that is, thoſe parts that are obnoxious unto the drawings out of the Podagrick fruits, when they are reſolved; and they have in the general an affinity with them, and therefore readily admit of, and give entertainment to the gueſt coming unto it) to wit, the joynts, or the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novia</hi> of the Hands and Feet.</p>
               <p>But here they do by their words obſcure a thing that is in it ſelf moſt plain, and they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe mingle falſities with truths. For as for what they bring touching the Ebullition of the <hi>Synovia,</hi> and the fervent boyling heat thereof, this <hi>Synovia</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> is a meer fiction and invention of his own; touching which we have already ſpoken in our Tract. <hi>de Conſenſ. &amp; diſ. Chymicor. cap.</hi> 15. But as for what they ſpeak of the ſalt Spirits, this (if it be rightly explained, and wel underſtood) is very agreeable unto the truth, as we ſhal ſhew you by and by. And ſo likewiſe we may wel enough bear with them in this, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to explain the differences of the pains in Arthritick perſons from the differences of the Salts that appear in Vegetables and Minerals; in regard that our own ableſt Phyfitians (and among the reſt, that moſt experienced <hi>Felix Platerus</hi>) are al of Opinion, that the humor which is the cauſe of <hi>Arthritis</hi> is not ſimply a Water, but endued with a quality of a different Nature, and mingled together with the <hi>Ichores</hi> and Excrements of the Humors, by which it is rendered more vehement. And ſo we likewiſe judg this more fit to be rejected in them (which yet <hi>Severinus</hi> delivereth unto us in words too obſcure) to wit, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excrementitious humors are moved unto other parts; and that the humor which is the cauſe of <hi>Arthritis</hi> hath in it a peculiar tendency unto the joynts; as we alſo ſhewed you above.
<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the cauſe of Arthritis.</note> And therefore (that we may at length conclude this controverſie) it appeareth from what hath been hitherto ſaid, that neither ſimply the blood, nor flegm, nor melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor yet a Water, is the neereſt and immediate cauſe of the <hi>Arthritis.</hi> But when I have wel weighed al thoſe things that befal Arthritick perſons, and which cannot poſſibly be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Humors (as is manifeſt by what hath been hitherto ſaid) I cannot otherwiſe determine, than that a ſalt, ſharp, ſubtile humor (and ſuch as for the moſt part reſembleth the nature of the ſalt ſpirits, is the nigheſt cauſe of <hi>Arthritis.</hi> And now, let who wil cal it Choler, or Flegm mingled with Choler, or Salt, or Tartar, or what he pleaſe, he may do it for me, ſo that the thing be but rightly explained. I for my part ſhal make uſe of the word <hi>Serum</hi> or Whey, Salt, and Tartar, that ſo I may likewiſe by a proper and peculiar word explain a thing that differeth from Choler and the ordinary and common Flegm. But now that the <hi>Serum</hi> or Whey is not only a watery humor, even the Ancients have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; and <hi>Galen</hi> in the ſixth of his <hi>Epidem. Comment</hi> 3. <hi>text.</hi> 33. writeth that the ſerous or wheyiſh blood is by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> called not only a Water, and a wateriſh humidity void of biting, but biting likewiſe and corroding; to wit, which reſembleth the nature of the Sallow or Willow ſpirits; and therefore it is that it pricketh and biteth thoſe parts that are ſo ſenſible and quick of feeling, and in theſe it exciteth moſt acute and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pains. There is, to wit, in the Earth (out of which Plants grow, whereby both Man and bruit Creatures are nouriſhed) ſomthing that is ſalt, which anſwereth unto Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; and it may not unfitly be called the ſalt of the Earth; which yet notwithſtanding is ſcarcely to be found pure and alone, but it is mingled together with other bodies; from whence divers kinds of Earths have their Original; and thereupon (according to the great variety of Soyls) it is very various and different; as Muddy, Clayie, &amp;c. and then at the length in Plants and Animals it is called Tartar; and ſo it cometh to be tranfuſed into men. But this, albeit that in Plants and Men it become in the many various Concoctions very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37365:78"/>and volatile (if it be not ſuch before) as very manifeſtly alſo it appeareth from the Salt of Urine, and that at length it is mingled even with the blood it ſelf: yet nevertheleſs in regard that from the very firſt original of it it is altogether unfit for the nouriſhing of the body, and is (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaketh) wholly unſerviceable thereunto, at the length (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be forthwith, even in the firſt Concoction, expelled forth by the belly or afterwards evacuated forth by ſweats and Urines) it is treaſured up; and being burdenſom to Nature it is thruſt forth unto the Joynts (as having a certain kind of neer allyance with ſuch like matter) where by its acrimony it exciteth moſt vehement and grievous pains. Neither let any be hereat moved, and wonder that we ſay that this matter is one while ſpiritual, and ſomtimes alſo Tartarous, and ſo very fit likewiſe for the generating of thoſe hard knots which they cal <hi>Tophi.</hi> For (that I may ſpeak with the Chymiſts) ſpinits may proceed from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and again bodies may be from ſpirits. This matter in its original, and while it was in the Earth, was a body, and ſomwhat as it were Earthy, and Mineral like: but it cometh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to be attenuated in the various Concections both in Plants and Men, and ſo it is made as it were ſpiritual: which hath been acknowledged by many of <hi>Galens</hi> followers; and among the reſt, by <hi>Cardanus,</hi> who upon the 47. and 49. Aphoriſms of the ſixth Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, writeth that the <hi>Matter,</hi> to wit, the cauſe of <hi>Arthritis,</hi> is as it were a ſpirit. And <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> in his <hi>Tragopodagra</hi> calleth it a violent and injurious ſpirit. And yet afterwards this thin humor or ſpirit, when it hath once gotten a fit place (to wit, the bones, and the places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the joynts) it again betaketh it ſelf into the body, and is there coagulated; like as it is a thing generally wel known unto the Chymiſts; and other ſalt ſpirits may again be coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and return into bodies. And yet nevertheleſs if any one ſhal aſſert that there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a volatile Salt in the very Earth it ſelf (which the Plants draw unto themſelves) this doth no way thwart or oppoſe this Opinion of ours; but the whol reſult of the buſineſs and Controverſie in hand cometh al unto one and the ſame concluſion.</p>

               <head>Queſt. 7. <hi>Where the Humor the cauſe of</hi> Arthritis, <hi>is generated, and by what waies it floweth into the Joynts.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN what place the Humor that is the cauſe of the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is bred, and by what waies and paſſages it floweth into the joynts, in this Phyſitians do greatly differ among themſelves: which diſagreement of theirs hath much hindered the Cure, and made it far more difficult than otherwiſe it would have been; and therefore not without cauſe is it that <hi>Fernelius</hi> (in his ſixth B. of the Diſeaſes of the parts, and the Symptoms, Chap. 18.) writeth that from the very ignorance of this thing the pain of the joynts hath hitherto been held and left for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, and called the ſhame and diſgrace of the Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>We have briefly above given you our Opinion as touching this thing in Controverſie. But becauſe there are many (and thoſe ſome of them of the more able and learned Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) that are of another Judgment, and differ from me in their Opinion (as in this darkneſs of Mans mind it is generally wont to be even in the greateſt and moſt ſerious Controverſies) I ſhal not think it time miſ-ſpent, nor my pains il beſtowed, in laying before you (with what brevity I can) their ſeveral Opinions; and in the recital of them I ſhal weigh them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>And firſt I ſhal indeed begin with <hi>Fernelius;</hi> who aſſerteth that they are much miſtaken, who think that the Humor the cauſe of <hi>Arthritis</hi> doth break forth of the more ſecret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the body into the Joynts. <hi>For how</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is it poſſible that any pure and ſincere humor can from the bowels, and the moſt inward ſeats be carried through the Veins; or that that humor which was ſo lately mingled with the blood ſhould now (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture thereof) by the Orifices of the veins fall pure into the blood; or if there ſhould alſo together with the humor flow forth any of the blood, which being collected and gotten together in the Joynts doth it not excite a Phlegmone? And why likewiſe doth not the crude humor which is carried into the Joynts by any other paſſages than by the Veins cauſe the</hi> Arthritis? <hi>For in the Cache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie, the crude humors that from the bowels fall down into the feet, and cauſe them to ſwell, do not yet excite the Gout in them.</hi> But even <hi>Fernelius</hi> himſelf taketh it for granted, and plainly aſſerteth that the Head is the Fountain and Original of this Malady, from whence (ſaith he) a flegmatick humor (and this very thin) floweth forth into the Joynts. And this humor (as he tels us) is not indeed gathered together in the Brain (as whoſe excrements are either purged forth by the Noſtrils, or elſe by the Palate fall down upon the great rough Artery, and the Lungs, or elſe into the Stomack, and the more inward ſeats) but it is (ſaith he) collected in the external parts of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37365:79"/>the Head, and ſuch as are placed without the Skul, and by the top and ſuperficies of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy run along downward under the Skin. For ſeeing that there are many Veins running forth thither that are derived from the external Jugular Veins, he conceiveth that they may there lay up their thin and ſerous excrements; and that in regard the Skin of the Head is thick and impenetrable (ſo that the humors cannot eaſily expire and breath through the ſame) that therefore in progreſs of time they are there ſtored up, and from thence by the ſuperficies and outſide of the body fall down into the joynts.</p>
               <p>There are very many other Phyſitians that follow this Opinion of <hi>Fernelius;</hi> of the which ſome of them wil have the humor (the Cauſe of <hi>Arthritis</hi>) to be collected in the Head alone, betwixt the Skul and the Skin of the Head; and they tel us that is the one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place from whence the matter floweth down unto the Joynts: but there are others of them, who although they likewiſe add other waies, yet notwithſtanding they do withall joyn this way of <hi>Fernelius:</hi> and there are very few or none of them, who do not believe but that this matter doth withall flow down likewiſe from this place of the Head.</p>
               <p>But in very truth, what <hi>Fernelius</hi> complaineth of touching the other Opinion (that by reaſon of it it ſo came to paſs that the Arthritis was almoſt leſt as a deſperate and incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſeaſe, and was termed the <hi>Opprobium</hi> or diſgrace of Phyſitians) I conceive (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſparagement unto any mans Judgment) that it may more truly be affirmed of this his own Opinion; and I am of Opinion that that Phyſitian who ſeeketh for the Spring and Fountain of this Malady in the Head only (neglecting in the mean time the true Fountain and ſourſe thereof) is ſcarcely ever likely to cure the <hi>Arthritis.</hi> For albeit it be indeed true, that certain various flitting and wandring pains may be here and there excited by the ſerous humor falling down from the extenal part of the Head under the Skin, by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and ſuperſicies of the Body; yet notwithſtanding the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is never from hence ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; neither is that matter wont to ſubſiſt about the Joynts, but for the moſt part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the membranes of the Joynts. But now the generating of the humor that is the Cauſe of the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is very different, and of a far other nature.

For when the Humors boyl with heat in the Arteries and Veins, and that they begin to be moved, they partly rove and run up and down by their own impe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which yet notwithſtanding doth nothing at all patronize this Opinion of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> ſince that even thoſe very Humors are not bred and collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Skin of the Head, (as he would have it) but they are ſuddenly pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth thither by the Veins and Arteries that are ſent unto the head from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Jugular Veins and Arteries. And grant it indeed to be true, that the Arthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick pains properly ſo called were excited in the Neck, as he ſaith: yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this is not done by the matter that by degrees is collected under the skin, and by little and little floweth thither, but becauſe the humors are poured out thither through the Capillary Veins by which thoſe Joynts are nouriſhed. For like as thoſe humors are carried down to the Feet by the deſcending trunk of the great hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Vein and Artery; ſo the ſame may be ſent upwards unto the head and the parts lying neer about it by the ſame trunk aſcending. And that there appeareth ſome kind of difference of the Symptoms in the ſick perſons, it happeneth from hence, that the humor floweth and is moved, ſomtimes by the trunk of the hollow Vein
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37365:80"/>and Artery aſcending, and ſomtimes by the ſame trunk deſcending (this being more uſual then the other) and now and then by both. For when it is moved upwards by the aſcending, before ever it cometh to the hands by the Axillar branches, ſomthing may eaſily be thruſt forth by the Jugulars (as well the external as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal) aſcending up into the head, as alſo into the Brain, and under the Skin; where ſome of theſe ſick perſons may be infeſted with reſt leſſneſs and want of ſleep, and others of them with a drowſineſs, and exceſſive propenſion to ſleeping and ſlumbring, and others of them by other Symptoms. But that that Humor which infeſteth the Toes ſhould be collected under the Skin of the Head, or poured forth thither out of the Veins and Arteries, and from thence flow down unto the Foot, this cannot be proved by any firm Reaſon. For what is that right and ſtraight way by the which it may ſuddenly flow ſtraight down from the head, under the Skin, unto the Feet and Toes? For when the matter deſtilleth from the head under the Skin, it is diſperſed hither and thither; and here and there it exciteth pains; but it doth not tend directly and ſtraight downward unto the extream parts of the Feet: neither likewiſe if it ſhould flow down by this way, could it poſſibly (as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it happeneth) ſo ſuddenly aſcend up into the Hand, by changing its way.</p>
               <p>And in ſpecial, as for what concerneth the exceſſive ſleepineſs and drowſineſs we oftentimes find in the ſick perſon, (and if there be any other Symptoms of this kind, that ariſe even in the very brain it ſelf) theſe do neither appear in every <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thritis;</hi> neither if they ſhould appear, would they at all confirm the Opinion of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> but rather confute it, as teaching us, that the matter is not generated and moved without the Skull, but that it is poured forth of the very Veins them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For this ſleepineſs and drowſineſs is cauſed from the matter that is heaped up within the brain, and not collected without the Skul; which if it be preſent in the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> it teacheth us thus much, to wit, that there is likewiſe ſome matter by the Veins and Arteries poured forth into the brain it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, it is manifeſt alſo by experience, that even other Diſeaſes (and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as are acute, whoſe matter ſticketh in the Veins, and about the Bowels) are changed and turned into the <hi>Arthritis;</hi> and then the thick U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chap.</hi> 3.) teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth that he himſelf became <hi>Arthritick</hi> from an acute Diſeaſe, when Nature by the Criſis had driven forth the Humors unto the Joynts, and eſpecially unto the Feet; which had not been, if the <hi>Arthritis</hi> were generated from a matter flowing down from the Head: touching which we ſhall likewiſe ſpeak more hereafter, when we come to examine the Opinion of <hi>Platerus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither are thoſe things of any great moment that <hi>Fernelius</hi> bringeth againſt the other Opinion, which we mentioned above, and conceive to be very agreeable to the truth. For when he demandeth, how a ſincere humor can flow unto the Joynts by the orifices of the Veins, he calleth that in queſtion which we may every day ſee done in perſons that are ſick. For Nature reteineth the blood as the treaſury of life; and leſt that it ſhould be defiled and corrupted by the vitious humors, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth them divers waies out of the Veins and Arteries. And certain it is that in the fluxes and Purgations of the belly it thruſteth forth the vitious humors alone out of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> (or great hollow Vein) unto the Meſaraicks, and from thence unto the Inteſtines: and by Critical ſweats it expelleth the vitious Humors (and theſe indeed ſomtimes ſincere, but moſt commonly ſtinking and of a very ill color) by the orifices of the Veins ending and terminated in the Skin. And the ſame it doth in the Eryſipelas, Scabbineſs, ſmal Pocks and Meaſles, and many other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; in which Nature (that ſo it may preſerve the Body ſafe and ſound) ſeparateth the vitious humors from the good blood, and expelleth them by the Orifices of the Veins. And yet notwithſtanding neither doth that Serous humor alwaies ſlow ſincere unto the Joynts, but oftentimes it likewiſe carrieth forcibly along with it the blood, and many times alſo other humors. But as for what <hi>Fernelius</hi> addeth, that if the blood ſhould flow forth together with the ſaid humor, it muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excite a <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> this indeed often happeneth as he himſelf confeſſeth, whil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as touching the <hi>Chiragra,</hi> or Gout in the hand, he thus writeth: <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in this affect a beating pain, with a Swelling, Redneſs, Heat, and for the moſt part with ſwoln and ſtrutting Veins.</hi> And touching the <hi>Podagra,</hi> or Gout in the Feet;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37365:80"/>
                  <hi>there is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a ſwelling preſent here like as in the</hi> Chiragra; <hi>as alſo a Redneſs, Heat, and beating pain both in the part, as alſo in the Veins lying round about it:</hi> al which are ſigns of an Inflammation. Whereupon likewiſe it is that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in the ſixth Section of his Aphoriſms, Aphor. 49.) attributeth this name unto the Arthritis, when he ſaith that ſuch as have the Gout are troubled likewiſe with a <hi>Phlegmone.</hi> And yet nevertheleſs every Inflammation is not neceſſarily ſuppurated; and that in the <hi>Arthritis</hi> the humors are not ſuppurated, this ſheweth not unto us the place from whence they flow forth, but rather argueth the Nature of the humor it ſelf, as being altogether unfit for ſuppuration; to wit, ſuch as is ſerous, ſalt, and tartarous; the thinner part whereof is diſcuſſed, but the thicker part thereof that is left behind is converted into hard knobs or knots. For there is nothing ſuppurated but the blood, or that which partaketh of the nature of blood, and hath ſomthing thereof mingled together with it.</p>
               <p>Neither yet doth this likewiſe prove that the humor deſcendeth from the head, to wit, that this Diſeaſe doth ſomtimes invade the party with a ſhaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or at leaſt with an ordinary and ſlight kind of Chilneſs and Cold. For this quaking and cold is no ſign at al of the humor deſcending from the head under the skin, but rather of the humors being poured forth out of the Veins, like as we ſee the very ſame to happen in feavers, and the <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others alſo there are (as <hi>Buſtachius Rudius</hi>) who think indeed that this matter floweth down from the head; but then that it doth flow unto the Joynts, not only without the Skul, (between the Skin and the pericranium, by the ſpaces that are under the Skin) but that it deſcendeth within the Scul alſo, by the extream ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the ſpinal Marrow: others there are alſo that tell us, how that it floweth down through the very middle of the ſubſtance of the ſpinal Marrow. But if it were thus, as they ſay, there ſhould rather a Palſy or Convulſion be from thence excited; and in the middle ſpace (by the which the humors ſhould flow) the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves ſhould likewiſe be affected.</p>
               <p>Others there are who Joyn both theſe Opinions together; and theſe tel us that the Humor doth partly flow from the head, and partly are conveyed through the Veins; and this is indeed the moſt common Opinion; which therefore <hi>Platerus</hi> is very large in the explaining thereof; who teacheth us that the Humors exciting the <hi>Arthritick</hi> pains may fal down either within or without the Veins. Within the Veins indeed, when the bloody humor cauſeth the hot <hi>Arthritis,</hi> (as ſome cal it) having the Feaver <hi>Synochus</hi> Joyned with it. For as by a ſubtile and thin blood poured forth into the ſuperficies of the Skin Eryſipelas's (that are accompanyed with the Feaver <hi>Synochus,</hi> or a continual Feaver) are excited; ſo likewiſe while it is poured forth into the ſeats of the Joynts, the pain of the Joynts (which the ſame feaver likewiſe doth accompany) is bred; ſo that indeed whoſoever they be that are Obnoxious unto both theſe Diſeaſes, when they are ſiezed upon by the Gout, they may then comfort themſelves with an Opinion and conceit that it is no more then an <hi>Eryſipelas:</hi> All which things are indeed moſt true and certain.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding he determineth likewiſe that the Serous or wheyiſh Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humors being heaped up together may excite the <hi>Arthritis;</hi> and that their Original is from the head, and that the Source and Spring of defluxions hath there its exiſtence, and that from it they flow down into the parts lying beneath: but that they are there ſomtimes heaped up together in its interior ſeat, betwixt the Skul, the crude and impure Blood affording matter unto it. For then that part of it that is altogether unuſeful for Nutrition, and Excrementitious, is by ſome and ſome heaped up in the brain, which when afterwards it falleth down it then breedeth the pains aforeſaid; which are accompanyed with a heavineſs of the head, and ſomtimes with a great pain therein, and other accidents, the ſure ſigns and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the matter there heaped up together. And he tels us that the Excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood is cauſed by the vice and errour either of the firſt, or the ſecond, or even of the third Concoction that is made in the brain; by reaſon, to wit, of ſome diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or weakneſs therein. And withal he telleth us that al this filth and excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Humors that are heaped up in the head, do either by Reaſon of their too great abundance, when they are ſtirred to and fro, flow downwards, or elſe they are preſſed forth, and poured all abroad by the external cold and the moyſtneſs
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37365:81"/>of the Air; or elſe that they are ſtirred up by the heat of the Sun, or ſome Bath, the Pores and paſſages being opened, and the expulſive faculty provoked.</p>
               <p>And yet he determineth likewiſe, that the very ſame ſerous and excrementitious humor may likewiſe be ſtored up without the Skul, betwixt it and the Skin, and that it may from thence flow down into the inferior parts.</p>
               <p>But he teacheth us that the waies and paſſages (by which this defluxion is from the Head) are very various. As for the humor collected within the Skul in the Baſis of the Brain (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of three Cavities ending in the very bottom of the Skul) he tels us that it is ſomtimes ſtrained through by the hole of the Bone they call <hi>Cribroſum</hi> (bearing ſome kind of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with a Sieve) and diſtilleth out of the Noſtrils, and that it then exciteth that diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation we cal <hi>Coryza,</hi> or the Poſe: and that ſomtimes likewiſe it is carried into the middle Cavity, which is full of holes, and looketh toward the Palate; and that then it is either blown forth by the Noſtrils, or brought forth of the Jaws, and ſpit out by ſcreaming and retching; or that deſcending into the ſeat of the Eyes, it exſtilleth forth by tears: and that ſometimes it followeth the conveyance of the Nerves in the midſt of this ſeat (of which ſome of them paſs through by theſe holes:) and that ſomtimes it being carried into the hinder Cavity of the Skul (which is lower and wider) it deſcendeth through the great hole (in the hinder part of the Head) of the Spinal Marrow, into ſome place of the habit of the Body; and that it ſtoppeth either in the fleſhy parts any where, or about the Region of the Joynts, and there cauſeth the aforeſaid pains of defluxions, or of the Joynts.</p>
               <p>But as for the humor collected without the Skull, and flowing downward under the Skin (as it inſinuateth it ſelf either into the Joynts or the fleſhy ſeats) he endeavoreth to produce divers kinds thereof: all which he explaineth at large.</p>
               <p>But in very truth, as we willingly admit of thoſe things that he produceth touching the motion of the humors without the Veins (in which he agreeth with <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi>) ſo we cannot be induced to believe that the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is generated from thence. For firſt of all, the matter that is generated in the Brain, and exciteth the <hi>Coryza,</hi> or abundance of ſpittle, and is caſt forth by the Noſethrils and the Jaws, it is of a far different nature from that which breedeth the <hi>Arthritis;</hi> and it could not poſſibly otherwiſe be, but that if a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo ſharp and fiery, as it were, ſhould be generated in the Brain, it muſt needs produce moſt grievous ſymptoms. And moreover whether this humor deſcend according to the paſſage of the Nerves, or according to the conveyance of the Spinal Marrow, it could not be, but that it ſhould firſt of all in its paſſage cauſe either a Convulſion or a Palſey, or ſome kind of pain, before ever it could come unto the extream part of the Feet and Toes, and ſhould there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite pain; whereas notwithſtanding on the contrary we oftentimes ſee (and eſpecially in the beginning of this Diſeaſe) that there is ſuddenly a pain excited in the Feet, no pain at all, or ſymptoms elſewhere appearing. And furthermore I likewiſe willingly indeed grant that from the matter heaped up under the Skin of the Head the pains of Defluxions (as <hi>Platerus</hi> rightly calleth them, and diſtinguiſheth them from the Arthritick pains; although he be miſtaken in this that he determineth that theſe pains and Defluctions are only in the fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhy parts of the Muſcles, whereas indeed they are equally about the Joynts) may be excited in the fleſhy places and Membranes of the Muſcles: but yet I cannot perſwade my ſelf that the <hi>Arthritis</hi> properly ſo called, returning by certain intervals, and having alwaies one time of duration, ſhould thence be generated. For if the humor ſhould fall down betwixt the Fleſh and the Skin, it muſt firſt of all ſeiz upon the parts nigh unto the Head, and upon the Joynts; ſeeing that (as <hi>Galen</hi> expreſly teacheth, in his 2. <hi>B. of the Difference of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Chap.</hi> 11.) thoſe fluxions that are from the Head are wont in the firſt place to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the parts neer unto the Head, as the Ears, Eyes, Teeth, Gums, and the Glandules that lie next, or the Breaſt and Lungs, and the Muſcles of the Back; whereupon ſuch like pains from a Defluxion preſently in the very firſt beginning of the deſcent of the humor from the Head are perceived in the neck (before and behind) and in the Shoulder blades; but they ſcarcely ever deſcend into the Toes (which indeed are moſt of al infeſted by the <hi>Arthritis</hi>) that ſame thin ſerous humor vaniſhing by the way; which happeneth not in the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> in which the pains are wont firſt of all (and that very ſuddenly) to be excited for the moſt part in the very ends of the Toes. For what <hi>Solenander</hi> writeth concerning a certain noble perſon (as we may find it in the 24. <hi>Conſil.</hi> of his fourth Section) who being troubled with the <hi>Arthritis</hi> about the latter end of the Winter, had (as he ſaith) the humors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moved from the Head, becauſe they were not ſuddenly augmented, but encreaſed by little and little, and running from Joynt to Joynt, from Foot to Foot, and from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Knee; and that from hence they aſcended and ſeized upon the Hands, and after this
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37365:81"/>inſinuated themſelves into the Joynts of the Elbow; this I ſay ſeemeth unto me a thing very improbable. For if the Humor had flown from the Head, it ought firſt of al to have infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the Elbows, and then the Hands; firſt the Knees, and then the Feet; whereas here the quite contrary was done. It ſeemeth more agreeable to truth, that this was done from the nature of the humor, and the great abundance thereof. For when it was more thick in the Winter time it is was moved the more ſlowly: but when once there was great ſtore thereof heaped up, Nature firſt of al drives it forth unto the extream parts, which when they could not poſſibly receive all of it, ſhe then afterwards thruſt it forth likewiſe unto the more neer neighboring parts. Neither indeed can I ſee any way, by which this humor heaped up without the Skul, ſhould be carried down ſtraight and directly unto the Feet, and not ramble and rove up and down, hither and thither, like as do thoſe pains from Defluxions. And be it ſo indeed that the Brain doth likewiſe ſometimes ſuffer certain ſymptoms; and that the pain may firſt of all begin in the nook of the Neck, and may after this ſeiz upon the Shoulder, afterwards upon the Elbow, and laſtly, upon the Hand; yet notwithſtanding that is not at all yet proved which ought to be, to wit, that this humor deſcendeth without the Skul, betwixt the Skin and the Fleſh. For firſt of all how the Gout <hi>Podagra</hi> comes to be bred in the Feet, is not ſhewn in this manner. And moreover, albeit the humor flow within the Veins and Arteries, there may the very ſame ſymptoms be produced in the Brain (which could not at all be if the humor were moved without the Skul, under the Skin) and alſo the ſame pain in the Nock, Shoulder, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow. Fot while nature is endeavoring to expel that vitious humor by the aſcending Trunk of the great hollow Vein, and Artery, there may very eaſily by the Jugular Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſomthing flow into the Brain, which may there excite ſome kind of ſymptoms; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever it come ſo far as the Hands, it may eaſily happen, that Nature may by thoſe Branches that are diſperſed throughout the Nook and the Shoulders thruſt forth ſomthing into thoſe parts. And whereas all the Joynts in the whol Body, as alſo the parts that lie about them receive their nouriſhment from the Veins and Arteries, there is no Joynt in the whole Body into which likewiſe the humor (the Cauſe of <hi>Arthritis</hi>) may not flow in by the very ſame Veſſels, ſo that there wil be no need at all of ſeeking for blind and hidden waies and paſſages even from the moſt remote parts. And that I may in the laſt place like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe grant this, that it may poſſible be, that ſuch like ſerous humors abounding in the Veins may alſo be thruſt forth into the Head, and pouted out under the Skin, and upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Arthritick Paroxyſm, and Nature ſetting her ſelf upon the work of expulſion, they may likewiſe be moved, and by the Neck may deſcend into the Back: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe are not thoſe humors that breed <hi>Arthritis;</hi> but deſcending under the Skin, and pulling the Membranes in the outſide of the Body, they excite thoſe roving and ſlitting pains; yea and ſometimes alſo they breed a ſpurious and baſtard Pleuriſie; but they are very eaſily taken away by frictions, diſcuſſing Medicaments, and Sweats, the <hi>Arthritis</hi> yet ſtil temaining.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franciſcus India</hi> (a Philitian or <hi>Verona</hi>) in his firſt <hi>B. of the Gout, Chap</hi> 4, rendreth this thing very intricate, whiles he writeth that the members that ſend forh theſe ſuperfluities are various and very many, and eſpecially the Head, the Stomack, the Inteſtines, the Liv, and the Kidneys; and that thoſe Fluxions are indeed more eſpecially from the Head, and from the Brain; becauſe that although thoſe humors draw their Original from the Inteſtines, and from the Stomack and other Members, before they flow unto the parts of the Joynts, they firſt of al aſcend into the Head, and from it are afterwards tranſmitted unto the parts lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath it. But yet he doth not indeed deny that thoſe humors proceed from the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For if (faith he) the Body were altogether free from ſuperfluities, no humor would at al ſlow in. And yet nevertheleſs he denieth that the matter doth immediately flow from the whol Body unto the Joynts, feeing it cannot poſſibly be, that the humor which is found in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, or the Inteſtines, or in the Liver, or Spleen, ſhould ſo ſuddenly from theſe parts flow unto the Joynts, unleſs by the incitation of Nature it were driven forth by thoſe waies that lead unto the Joynts. Now he determineth that thoſe waies are the Veins, Muſcles, and Nerves. The Veins, to wit, that are deſtined for the nouriſhing of the Hands and Arms, do carry the excrementitious humors that have their exiſtence throughout the whole Body unto the Ligaments of the Fingers, the Tendons, and the Joynts. But the Muſcles that ariſe from the Shoulder-blades, and the very top of the <hi>Spina</hi> and that are implanted into the Shoulders do receive the ſame excrements from the inſerior parts of the Body, and derive them unto the Ligaments of the Fingers, But as for that matter which floweth from the Head, Nature thruſteth it forth unto the Joynts of the Fingers by thoſe Nerves that deſcend from the Head. And yet notwithſtanding afterward he denieth that the humor it carried from
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37365:82"/>the Head alone unto the inferior parts of the Body; as for Inſtance, unto the Knees, the Thighs, and the Ligaments and Joynts of the Toes; but that by the conſent of the Veins and Nerves of the <hi>Spina</hi> or Back-bone, and by reaſon likewiſe of the conſent betwixt the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and the Knees, Thighs and Feet, it is ſomtimes alſo carried from the ſaid <hi>Spina</hi> of the Back and from the Kidneys unto the Ligaments of the Knees and unto the Joynts of the Toes.</p>
               <p>But in this Opinion there are contained many things that are falſe. For firſt of all, whereat it is ſaid that the matter floweth from the whol body unto ſome one place, we are not hereby to underſtand al and every part of the body, she ſtomack, the Inteſtines, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Kidneys, and other parts, but only thoſe kind of parts in the whol body that are filled with Veins. For although that the excrementitious humors may be generated in the ſtomack, Inteſtines, Liver, and Spleen: yet when they are heaped up, they are then diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into the great hollow Vein, as alſo into the Arteries, with that perpetual flux and paſſage to and again of the blood; and from hence they are thruſt forth unto the external parts of the body, as in the <hi>Scabies</hi> we may ſee, and ſo likewiſe in very many other Affects. And therefore if vitious humors be heaped up in Arthritick perſons, there is no need at all that they ſhould be derived unto the Joynts by ſo many turnings and windings, by the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and by the Nerves; ſeeing that there is a neer and direct way through the Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, from which as al other parts of the body, ſo likewiſe the Joynts receive their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And furthermore it is no way agreeable to truth that the humors ſhould flow unto the Joynts by the Nerves: for neither do the Nerves eaſily admit of, and receive ſo great an abundance of humors; neither were impoſſible, if that matter were received by the Brain, and ſhould flow unto it through the Nerves, but that it ſhould firſt of al excite moſt grievous Maladies, before ever the <hi>Arthritis</hi> could ariſe and appear. <hi>India</hi> indeed ſeeks by al means to avoid al theſe inconveniences, whiles in his ſixt Chapt. he writeth, that the matter which floweth doth not fill the Nerves within; but only diſtend the ſame cutwardly. But this is not to flow through the Nerves: neither doth he in this manner ſhun thoſe inconveniences, whiles he doth not ſhew us how by a continual paſſage from the Head (according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Nerves) this matter may flow, ſo that yet notwithſtanding it may in its way and paſſage excite neither Convulſion nor Palſey, nor any other pain. And indeed to what end is there any need of thoſe ambages, and turnings and windings about (this way and that way) by the Muſcles; when (as we have already often ſaid) there lieth a direct and ſtraight way out of the Veins and Arteries into the Joynts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adrian Spigelius</hi> (in his B. of the <hi>Arthritis</hi>) hath a peculiar Opinion as being held by him alont: who when he would acknowledg that this afflux is altogether made by the Veins and Arteries, and yet nevertheleſs would not altogether deſert that Opinion which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth that the humors flow down from the Head, and would withal give us nonce, that that flux cannot poſſibly be either without the Skul, or within it, and ſo from the Brain; he therefore determineth, that the fluxion is both from the Head, and from the Liver: but then in this he diſſenteth from all others. that he teaceth us that the aforeſaid fluxion (which he conceiveth to proceed from the Head) is very ſeldom under the Skin (as <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> tels us it is) and never by the hole of the Spinal Marrow (by which the Spirits are kept together) or by the hole of the Nook, above the external Membrane of the Spinal Marrow; but that by the Veins and Jugular Arteries (not only the external, but likewiſe the internal, by the which from the lower parts, eſpecially the Liver, the humor is carried into the external and internal parts of the Head) it floweth back again into the great hollow Vein, and the great Artery, or its branches that have their exiſtence under the Throat; and that ſo from thence they are devolved into the Joynts.</p>
               <p>And the very truth is, that <hi>Spigelius</hi> his Opinion is indeed right, That the flux of humors in the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is by the Veins and Arteries; which he might wel learn even from this, by obſerving that if before the univerſal evacuation of the body there be applied unto the Foot, or the Hand, any external repelling or cooling Medicaments, that then the matter flowed back unto the noble parts, and excited acute Feavers, and other Maladies. But that the matter doth from the Brain firſt of al regurgitate into the Veins and Arteries, this he doth not at al prove, but produceth it without any firm ground and reaſon. For on the contrary rather, thoſe things that happen unto Arthritick perſons do teſtifie that this humor is neither genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Brain, nor heaped up there, nor thence regurgitates into the Veins and Arteries; ſince that if this ſhould happen, a humor ſo ſharp as this is, and able to effect ſo great pains, muſt needs excite the moſt grievous Affects in the Brain. <hi>Spigelius</hi> here ſeeks for ſhifts, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many things teach us that theſe humors are bred in the Liver and Spleen, the places
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37365:82"/>and ſtore-houſes of Sanguification, and that from thence they are heaped up in the Veins and Arteries, and by them at length thruſt forth into the joynts; ſo that there is no need at al of deriving them from the Brain.</p>
               <p>Some there are who determine that the humors are poured forth unto the joynts from the whol body. But theſe by the whol can here underſtand nothing elſe but the Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, diſperſed throughout the whol body.</p>
               <p>But that we may at the length conclude this long and tedious diſputation, and contract it into a few words; this in the firſt place is certain, that the matter the cauſe of <hi>Arthritis</hi> is generated in the Bowels of the lower belly; yea, and that oftentimes it is long ſtabled up (as it were) about the Spleen the Inteſtines, and the Liver, until at the laſt it is transferred into the great hollow Vein. And <hi>Mercatus</hi> writeth moſt truly, that as he himſelf had ſeen when the pains of the joynts had ariſen from the pains of the belly; ſo he likewiſe found the ſame to be the Opinion of Authors none of the meaneſt; and I my ſelf have alſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it more than once in ſuch perſons as were Hypochondriacal, and ſuch as have had the ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy: and from hence likewiſe it is, that <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> fluxes unſeaſonably ſuppreſſed are turned into the <hi>Arthritis.</hi> And that there may flow from the <hi>Colon</hi> Inteſtine a humor exciting the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> we are taught both by <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in 6. <hi>Epidem. Com.</hi> 4. <hi>Text.</hi> 3. And as for the waies and paſſages the thing is very plain (as we likewiſe told you before, touching the Scurvy:) to wit, that from the <hi>Colon</hi> this humor may by the Meſeraick Arteries be transſerred into the Trunk of the great Artery, and from hence be thruſt unto the joynts.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, This alſo is true and certain, (and that which is granted by all the moſt learned Phyſitians) that the Humor the cauſe of the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is moved through the Veins and Arteries (ſome of theſe ſay alwaies, but others of them very often, and they are thoſe that determine that the humor floweth down likewiſe from the Head) and the thing is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo plain, that <hi>Thomas Eraſtus</hi> (who notwithſtanding in his 4. <hi>Diſputat.</hi> againſt <hi>Paracelſ.</hi> Page 261. defendeth likewiſe another way from the Head) writeth, that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can doubt of this thing who doth not ſufficiently attend, and take notice of what is day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, or he that hath his minde prepoſſeſſed with a prejudicate Opinion.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that theſe things are true and certain, the doubt now lieth in this, Whether this way be not ſufficient? and whether there may any other be aſſigned? and whether the humors alſo flowing down from the Head, under the Skin, may excite the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> yea or no? And yet notwithſtanding (in the third place) I conceive that this is alſo moſt true and certain, and ſufficiently proved above, that ſomtimes the beginning of the fluxion is not from the Head. For whereas both the part tranſmitting, and the part receiving, do both of them diſcover themſelves by their ſeveral and proper ſymptoms; and that in many Arthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick perſons there appeareth no heavineſs of the head, no pain, neither any other ſymptoms as ſigns and tokens of any humor gathered together and heaped up there; it cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be concluded that the humor floweth down from the Head. And moreover, neither hath that <hi>Arthritis</hi> which is from the Collick its original from the head, or from the brain, as before we ſhewed you: as likewiſe neither that which proceedeth from a <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably and unduly ſuppreſſed. And therefore fourthly, this remaineth that may truly be doubted of, to wit, Whether or no the <hi>Arthritis</hi> may ſomtimes have its original from a matter heaped up under the Skin of the Head, and from thence flowing down? Which indeed very many of the moſt learned and able Phyſitians do affirm, whom I leave free unto their own judgments: but yet for my own part I cannot be perſwaded to beleeve it, for the reaſons before alleadged; which here to repear, I hold it altogether needleſs, in regard eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that I am able very wel to render a reaſon of al thoſe ſymptoms that befal unto Arthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick perſons; although I determine that the humor the cauſe of <hi>Arthritis</hi> is moved only within the Veſſels, and that by them it floweth into the joynts; eſpecially if this be well heeded, that this humor doth ſomtimes moſt chiefly flow through the deſcending Trunk of the hollow Vein, and the great Artery, and ſomtimes likewiſe that it withal floweth by the aſcending Trunk; and that from thence various ſymptoms are excited about the head. What need is there therfore that neglecting thoſe waies which Nature hath ordained as Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels for the motion and flux of the humors, we ſhould ſeek for unknown and unheard of waies? And there is one thing that I cannot but at leaſt touch upon; and it is this, That <hi>Eraſtus</hi> indeed (in the place alleadged) hath this for a ſure and certain ſign of the humor its flowing from the head, that the ſick perſons do for the moſt part manifeſtly feel and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the humor to flow down from the head, by the neck, ſides, and back, like unto a water,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37365:83"/>with a kind of ſhaking, trembling, or a ſlight kind of cold. But this ſign ſeems not unto me any whit firm: for that ſhivering and quaking happeneth not only in the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes likewiſe in Feavers, the <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> ſmal Pox, and Meazels; and it is a ſign and token that theſe Diſeaſes are very nigh at hand; when from the Trunk of the hollow Vein and Artery (eſpecially in the back) by the branches that ariſe from them, and the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Veins and Arteries, a vapor from the vitious humor, or likewiſe the thinner part thereof is thruſt forth into the parts of the back. For although that without doubt alſo the very ſame happeneth even in other parts, yet nevertheleſs this Chilneſs and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling is firſt of al excited in the back, by reaſon of the Spinal Marrow, and the very many Nerves there proceeding from the ſaid Spinal Marrow, and being endued with a moſt quick and exquiſite ſenſe; by the which Spinal Marrow a Chilneſs and ſhivering is likewiſe ſeen ſomtimes to aſcend, and ſomtimes to deſcend: touching which ſee more in <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> his fifth Section, and 69. Aphoriſm. And thus much may ſuffice as touching this Controverſie.</p>

               <p>NOt only <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and his followers (who derive the <hi>Arthritis</hi> from the ebullition of <hi>Synovia</hi>) have given me occaſion to think of this Queſtion; but likewiſe thoſe ſtrange and admirable Cures that have now and then been made in the <hi>Arthritis</hi> have chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put me upon the debate hereof. <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> (in his firſt Century, Epiſt. 47. and 48.) relateth that ſome by tortures have been ſo freed from the <hi>Arthritis</hi> that they were never known afterward to undergo any fit thereof. Indeed by affrightment, as alſo by joy, it is a thing very wel known that many have been freed from the Arthritick Paroxyſms. But how a man ſhould in this manner perpetually be freed from the <hi>Arthritis</hi> or joynt-Gout, it is not ſo eaſie a thing to render the reaſon thereof, unleſs it be ſought for in the place affected. And there are likewiſe other Hiſtories of this very thing. That famous and eminent perſon, Dn. D. <hi>Doringius</hi> related unto me, that there was a Citizen of <hi>Gieſſa,</hi> who (through impatience by reaſon of his pain) with a hatchet cut off the great Toes of both his Feet; and ever after this he lived altogether free from the <hi>Arthritis. Andreas Libavius</hi> likewiſe (in his 73. Epiſt. to <hi>Schinzeurs</hi>) relateth ſuch a ſtory as this. There was (ſaith he) a Patient, an Hoſt, or publick Inholder: A certain Phyſitian (a Chevalier, a perſon of great quality) happening to be there, having agreed with him for three hundred Florens, promiſed the Cure; and when he had received a Writing under his hand for the ſaid Sum he ſets upon it. The Patient is commanded to put his feet upon a Wooden Trunk. There were preſent the ſervants of this Noble Knight (able and ſtrong men) that were commanded to hold him down in a ſitting poſture. The Knight himſelf being provided of an Iron Maller, with ſix Nails faſtened his feet unto this Trunk of Wood; and immediately with all the ſpeed that he could, leaving his Patient crying out in a moſt miſerable manner, taketh his Horſe, and away he rideth. But in the mean time he oftentimes privately with all the whether the Diſeaſe had ever after returned. And having underſtood (after the ſpace of three yeers) that the Patient had never again been troubled with the aforeſaid Diſeaſe, he returneth back unto the Inn; and there making himſelf merry with his Hoſt, be came fully to know that the Diſeaſe was cured. And thereupon he puls forth the Writing that he had under the Hand and Seal of his Hoſt, and demandeth the Money that was promiſed him, having made it appear that he was the Phyſitian that had wrought the Cure. His Hoſt (although he had been moſt cruelly handled by him) conſenteth to ſatisfie him; and accordingly he ſed him and his Followers ſo long, until they had eaten and drunk out the three hundred Florens.</p>
               <p>From al which Hiſtories it ſeems that we may collect thus much; That in the place affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted there lieth hid ſome kind of Mine, which in its own time maketh much for the exciting of the Paroxyſm. But although it be very hard to determine any thing of a certainty as touching this thing; yet notwithſtanding I wil acquaint you with my own thoughts (as leaſt in the way of a Paradox) unto which I deſire not ſtrictly to engage any man to give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but ſhal leave every one unto his own Judgment and Opinion.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:37365:83"/>
               <p>All the parts of the Body, as they are nouriſhed by an Aliment fit and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for them; ſo likewiſe in ſick and Crazy Bodies, the Humors that bear a certain Analogy with them are carried up and down unto the other parts; whereupon there happeneth a vitious and corrupt Nutrition. In thoſe that are ſound that which is unuſeful for the nouriſhment of the other parts is (in men) waſted and conſumed in the Nails and Haires; and in Bruites alſo it is converted into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Hoofs and Horns. In ſuch as are unſound and ſick, the vitious Humors are alſo carried unto the parts appointed for them; which as it happeneth in other Diſeaſes, ſo we may ſee it more eſpecially in the <hi>Plica Polonica;</hi> in which that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Humor is not only driven forth unto the haires of the head, which it clammeth and as it were gleweth faſt together, but likewiſe unto the Nails of the Feet, which are thereupon made hard and black. In the Fractures of the bones the ſtone <hi>Oſteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colla</hi> being taken tendeth unto the bones; and paſſeth into a <hi>Callus,</hi> (and this ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overgreat) as <hi>Guilhelmus Fabricius</hi> makes it appear unto us by examples, in his <hi>firſt Cent. Obſervat.</hi> 90. and 91.) if therefore Humors fit for the generating of the <hi>Arthritis</hi> be mingled with the blood; it is very probable that they are carryed unto the Joynts, and that with the Aliment of the bones they inſinuate themſelves into the very ſubſtance of them; and that there the Excrement proper unto the bones is collected, as a Mineral and Rudiment of the <hi>Arthritis</hi> that is to follow. And <hi>Galen</hi> ſeemeth to teach us this very manifeſtly, whiles in the 39. <hi>Aphoriſm.</hi> of the 5. <hi>Section,</hi> he telleth us that each part of the Body as it hath its Nutriment, ſo it hath likewiſe its Excrement; and that there is a ſuperfluous Humor left behind, like unto the Nature of the part where it remaineth. And indeed it is a thing very likely and agreeable unto the truth, that there ſhould be ſuch a Tartarous excrement collected, eſpecially in the appendances of the bones, which are more porous then the Reſt of the parts of the bones; and therefore (as <hi>Andreas Laurentius</hi> hath it in his <hi>Second B.</hi> and 4. <hi>Chap.</hi>) they are ſo framed, that they may be as it were the bellies of the Bones, in the which the Aliment of the bones may be concocted, which by degrees may be ſtreyned through into their Caverns. If therefore any ſuch humor, or Excrement, ſhall be collected in the bones, the like humor flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, it boy leth as it were with heat; which being done, it is diffuſed into the parts lying neareſt; and there it exciteth a pain in them: and this is eſpecially done in the <hi>Epiphyſes</hi> or additions of the bones, out of which the Ligaments ariſe, and by which the ſenſible parts about the Joynts are knit together. But if the ſaid Humor or Excrement, be diſſipated, or poured out in any other manner, it is credible that the ſick perſon is then altogether freed from the <hi>Arthritis.</hi> Whereupon alſo it is not without good cauſe that ſuch Medicaments as conſume the humors about the Joynts (and wholly dry them up) are here greatly commended. And this might likewiſe have been brought for the confirmation of this Opinion, that ſuch as are Arthritick are prognoſticators of the weather (as they ſpeak) and they perceive in their Feet change of Air, and Alteration in the weather; and as the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple uſe to ſay, they have an Almanack in their Feet. Which indeed <hi>Johannes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicus</hi> (in his <hi>Roſa Anglica</hi>) thinketh to happen, becauſe that Air may enter into the Joynts the more freely by Reaſon of their Vacuity and Dilatation. But this Reaſon is of no moment, in regard that the pain is not in the Dilatation. But this Reaſon is of no moment, in regard that the pain is not in the Cavities of the Joynts; and becauſe likewiſe that other parts have greater Cavities, which yet feel no ſuch thing: but without doubt, this pain doth therefore ariſe, becauſe that the neer approaching Changes of the Air do forcibly ſtir up and move the Excrementitious humors ſticking in the Joynts.</p>
               <p>And if any one would interpret the Opinion of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and his followers in the beſt ſence, he may even here have a good ground for his ſo doing. For <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and <hi>Petrus Severinus,</hi> teach us that the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is generated from the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary heat and Ebullition of the <hi>Synovia;</hi> where if by <hi>Synovia</hi> they underſtand a Humor not Natural, but ſomthing that is Excrementitious collected in the Joynts, they then teach us the very ſame that hath hitherto been ſpoken of. But <hi>Quercetan</hi> in his <hi>Conſil. of the Gout in the Joynts,</hi> and <hi>the Stone,</hi> doth explain the ſame far more cleerly; where he determineth, that the Tartar that is heaped up together, and conteined in the Joynts is the nigheſt and moſt immediate Cauſe of the <hi>Arthritis;</hi> and that it is ſomtimes contemed in the Joynts, and there remaineth idle: but ſo ſoon as there is any new fluxion, (which for cibly moveth it) it then exciteth a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37365:84"/>no otherwiſe, then as it is when Water is poured upon burning Lime, there is then a certain Ebullition, and heat.</p>

For in the time of</hi> Hippocrates <hi>there were very few of any condition that were affected with this Difeaſe, by Reaſon of their temperate lives, and their Extraordinary Moderation. But in this our Age, (wherein there hath been ſo great an augmentation of delights, Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, and pleaſures, that there cannot well be any further addition unto them) there is an infinite multitude of ſuch as are troubled with the Gout; ſome never ſo much as exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing themſelves, but ill digeſting and concocting their food, and continually diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves with all ſorts of drink, without raking any Meat at all before their drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſtrong wines; and overmuch addicted to venery; and others of them (if they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not in all and every of theſe particulars, yet) in ſome one or other of theſe exceſſes taking too great a liberty.</hi> And in the 29. <hi>Aphor. touching Women,</hi> he writeth: <hi>This was formerly a truth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Women (before their monthly Courſes failed them) were not at all ſo much as attempted by the Gout, by Reaſon of thoſe few Errours and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes they were guilty of in the former Age.

And therefore what wonder is it that the beſt of Phyſitians hath been found in a lie, in regard that there are ſo many Women troubled with the Gout?

               <head>Queſtion, 10. <hi>Whether the</hi> Arthritis <hi>be Curable.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is the common and received Opinion of many, that the <hi>Arthritis</hi> is altogether incurable. And the very truth is, there have been many found thus affected, whom the aforeſaid Diſeaſe hath attended all their life long, and even unto their dying day. Whereupon it likewiſe happeneth that many of theſe Arthritick perſons (conceiving their Diſeaſe to be deſperate) will not at al ſeek unto the Phyſitian for his advice; and for the ſame reaſon alſo they refuſe to abſtain from any Errors in Diet. But on the contrary, there are many examples to be found of ſuch as either by the aſſiſtance of Phyſitians, or by a good Diet, or by ſome ſudden and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted chance and accident have been freed from the Gout, and have ever after lived altogether free from the ſame. <hi>Porphyry</hi> (in the life of <hi>Plotinus</hi>) writeth, that <hi>Rogatianus,</hi> a Senatour of Rome, a Platoniſt, and Scholar of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> by his frugal and ſparing Dyet attained ſo much benefit in this affect, that when as before he was very violently handled and vexed with the Gout, ſo that he could not ſo much as go one ſtep forward, but was fain to be carryed in his Chair, he hereby reaſſumed his ſtrength again; and whereas before he was not able to ſtretch forth his hands, he by this his frugality and temperance became ſo wel recovered, that he had now more command of his hands, and could upon all occaſions uſe them more expiditely then ſuch as did their dayly drudgery with them. And ſo likewiſe above (out of <hi>Trincavel</hi> his 12. <hi>B.</hi> and 2. <hi>Chap. Touching the manner of curing the affects of all the parts of Mans Body</hi>) we related a ſtory of a certain Phyſitian (an old man) at <hi>Venice,</hi> who by his abſtaining from wine by the ſpace of five years was delivered from the <hi>Arthritis</hi> or Gout during his whole life, even unto the very day of his Death. And we likewiſe related unto you before (out of <hi>Franciſcus Alexander</hi>) of one <hi>Francis Pecchius</hi> (a man much troubled with the Gout) who being caſt into priſon, and there detained for twenty years, was in the end freed both from his impriſonment and all his Arthritick pains, and ſo continued free from all fits of the Gout for ever after during his Natural life: And <hi>Marcus Gattinaria</hi> (in <hi>that Chap.</hi> of his <hi>Book, touching the Cure of the pains of the Joynts from a hot Cauſe</hi>) writerh as concerning himſelf; that when he firſt began to ſuffer the fits of the Gout, this was the Courſe he took for the recovery of his health, and eaſe from his fits: to wit, firſt of all, he impoſed upon himſelf an abſtinence from Wine for two years, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very month he emptied his Body by Evacuations, and then he took ſome Pill or other for the diverting of the Humor, (the cauſe of his diſtemper) and this he made uſe of twice in the week; that ſo Nature might be diverted in her tranſmitting the matter unto the Joynts, and that ſo ſhe might rather evacuate it by the way of ſiege: and by uſing this courſe for a while he was ſo throughly Cured, that he was never after that troubled with any ſuch like pains. And <hi>Carolus Piſo</hi> alſo (<hi>in his Book of Diſeaſes from Serous or Wheyiſh impurities,</hi> in his <hi>Conſil. touching the Arthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>) writeth, that a certain man who had lived all the time of his youth infeſted with perpetual pains of the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> and making his moan and continual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints thereof; by the counſel and advice of <hi>Nicolaus Piſo,</hi> in the flower of his Age, he wholly denyeth unto himſelf the uſe of Wine, although he were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of thoſe that were ſet over and had the charge of a Wine-Cellar (a rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample indeed of admirable temperance) and ſo by thus doing he kept himſelf for thirty years together (al the time of his life after) altogether free from thoſe pains. And Hiſtories likewiſe teſtifie, that ſome even by a due and orderly regularing of their lives, and others again by their being reduced unto poverty, and ſo neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto a frugality in point of Dyet, have thereby been wholly freed and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Gout. And this withal is a thing moſt ſtrange and wonderful (of which <hi>Guilbelm. Fabricius</hi> relateth three examples, in his <hi>Firſt Cent.</hi> and 79. <hi>Obſervat.</hi>) that ſome certain Arthritick perſons there have been, who upon ſuſpition of ſome Notorious Offences by them
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37365:85"/>committed, have been oftentimes ſet upon the wrack, and put upon the extreameſt of all exquiſite Tortures; but when they have conſtantly maintained their own innocency, they have at once been abſolved and for ever ſet free from their Crimes, and withal from the fits of the Gout, with the which they had formerly been moſt grievouſly afflicted. And wonderful alſo is that example which the ſame Author (in his firſt <hi>Cent. Epiſt.</hi> 47.) relateth of a certain envious and malecontented Perſon that lay ſick of the Gout; who though he were faſtened unto his ſick Bed by his painful Diſeaſe, could not yet refrain from traducing and ſpeaking ill of others. Which when a merry conceited Fellow there preſent percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (who had alſo himſelf been laſht by the petulancy of the others Tongue) about the dusk of the Evening (taking his opportunity when the ſick Perſon was left all alone by all his Family) enters the ſick mans Houſe privily in a ſtrange diſguiſe that he had gotten, like unto an Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hiopian or Blackmoor, and thus diſguiſed he goeth neer unto the Bed-ſide of the ſick Perſon; who aſtoniſhed with the unuſualneſs of the form, his own ſolitarineſs, and withall terrified with the darkneſs of the place it ſelf that he lay in, demandeth of him who he was, and from whence he came. The Whifler anſwering to none of his Queſtions, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his approach cloſer unto the Bed-ſide catcheth him by the Arms (which were likewiſe much troubled and pained with the <hi>Arthritis</hi>) and having thus laid hold on him he throweth him upon his back, and to hanging upon the ſame and crying out with all the noiſe he could make, he carrieth him out of the Chamber where he lay, ever and anon cruſhing his Feet againſt the Stairs by which he was to go down. When he was come into the Yard, he there ſets down his burden, putting the ſick Perſon upon his Feer, ſpeaking not a word to him all this while, only ſtaring him ful in the Face. And then ſuddenly again he runs towards him and made as though he would once more have ſeized upon him, and ſo have carried him out of the Houſe. But now he who before could not ſo much as ſet his Feet to the Ground, by reaſon of his Diſeaſe, nor walk at all upon plain Ground, much leſs get up any whither by the Steps, now runs as faſt as he could up Staits, and to the top of them he gets, and ſo into his Bed-Chamber he comes, and thorow the Window with the loud noiſe he made all the Neighborhood was raiſed, and ſo come running in unto him to ſee what the matter was. He out of Breath as he was, and half dead with affrightment, tels them that he was by a Ghoſt dragg'd out of the Bed where he lay, and then being carried forth of his Lodging-room he was moſt miſerably handled; and that had he not often called upon and ingeminated the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> he had without doubt been gone, had there been no more men in the world: And wonderful indeed it was, that he who was before ſo ſorely afflicted with the Gout ſhould hereupon recover his health and ſtrength, and never after be troubled with any the leaſt fit of his former Diſeaſe. <hi>Fabricius</hi> hath there likewiſe another Hiſtory of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Malefactor that had the Gout, who being brought forth and led unto Execution (his puniſhment being to have his Head cut off) by that time be was come half way to the place of execution there was brought him an unexpected Pardon granted him by the Clemency of his Gracious Prince. The miſerable man was ſo affected with this good tidings, that he who til now wanted the uſe of almoſt all his extream Members, now on a ſuddain caſt himſelf on his Feet with a quick and ſpeedy motion, and lived after this for many yeers wholly free from all kind of pain and trouble that formerly he had undergone by reaſon of the Gout. And I my ſelf remember likewiſe that we had here with us not long ſince a Noble Youth, much troubled with the Gout; this Youth, the neer neighboring houſes happening one Night to be all on Fire, and the Houſe wherein he was in danger to be burnt, he ſuddenly for fear gets him out of his Bed, and down a Ladder he runs; and intending to fly into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe, he fell (with that Foot where his grief lay) into a pit which the Winters Ice had made, it being now ful of Water; and ſo by this means was freed not only from the preſent fit, but likewiſe from al other pains of the Gout for the future; and ſo he lived many yeers after. Neither have we only examples of thoſe who either by an exact and accurate Diet, or by affrightment, or Joy, and the like means, have been delivered from the Gout; but we have examples of them likewiſe who have been recovered by the help of Medicaments. <hi>Cardanus</hi> (in his B. of admirable Cures, Numb. 16.) relateth four examples of ſuch as he himſelf had recovered of the Gout. And we have likewiſe other examples mentioned; of which we find certain of them in <hi>Schenkius</hi> his fifth Book of Obſervat. And <hi>Solenander</hi> alſo (in his 5. <hi>Sect. Conſil.</hi> 1.) writeth in this manner: <hi>As we have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>known ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have been cured by others, ſo we have alſo our ſelves ſet many free from the Gout for divers yeers together; and this we have done by curing them without any great ado, who before every half yeer (and ſomtimes oftner) were greatly afflicted with the Gout: of whom ſome are yet alive to teſtifie the truth of what I ſay.</hi> And very remarkable is that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37365:85"/>which <hi>Carolus Piſo</hi> (in the place alleadged) relateth in this manner: <hi>One</hi> Cornelius Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus Picardus <hi>(a man well skilled in Rhetorick) was ſubject unto the Gout, from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth yeer of his age, and ſo forwards, the Arthritis returning oftentimes every yeer, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And thirdly, another thing wherein they offend is this, That moſt of thoſe that are Arthritick deſire only the mitigation and aſſwagement of their preſent pain; and ſo that they may but be freed from the Paroxyſm they lie under, they think that the worſt is now paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And very few there are of them that will deny themſelves the uſe of Wine, the drinking of which unleſs it be omitted, there is an very many Patients no hope at al of a perfect cure.

Neither yet notwithſtanding is this at all to be denied, That there are ſome, who although they do not commit any notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errors in the courſe of their Dyet, yet they can hardly be freed from the Gout, becauſe that the greateſt part of their Aliment (by reaſon of the weakneſs of their bowels) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into vitious humors, like as we ſee that there are in others alſo virtous humors elſwhere collected. And therefore in regard that it is oftentimes impoſſible to correct that weakneſs of the bowels, the <hi>Arthritis</hi> likewiſe from thence proceeding wil ſcarcely ever be cured.</p>

               <p>BAths are by many Phyſitians commended unto Arthritick perſons; and many alſo thus affected betake themſelves unto theſe Baths, as unto the only ſacred Anchor of their Hopes, and a moſt ſure Refuge, as from whence they expect an eaſing of al their pains and tortures. But yet on the contrary, Experience hath often taught us, that ſome even in thoſe very baths have fallen into the fits and pains of the Gout; and that others likewiſe by the uſe of the ſaid Baths have become much the worſe. And therefore ſeeing that there is a Truth in both theſe Aſſertions; to wit, That Baths are ſomtimes uſeful and good for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thritick perſons, and now and then likewiſe very hurtful for them; we muſt firſt of all know that from Baths alone there was never yet any that ever recovered (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that the Baths do ſomtimes help, and ſomtimes hurt the perſon thus affected, this is not to be aſcribed meerly and ſimply unto the Baths, but unto the conſtitution of the ſick perſon, and likewiſe the courſe of Dyet by him obſerved whilſt he made uſe of thoſe Baths. For if the Body ſhal be firſt rightly evacuated, ſo that there are only the reliques and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders to be conſumed, and that the Joynts be to be ſtrengthened, Baths may then be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as very fit and profitable for the ſick perſon. For they do more powerfully diſſolve and diſſipate the remainders of the Humors in the joynts than do any Medicaments whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo ſtrengthen the parts; and withal (if the uſe of them be temperate) they che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and preſerve the Native heat of the Body. But if the Body be ſtill impure, and as yet ful of vitious humors, the Baths melt and pour al abroad theſe vitious humors; whereupon the ſick perſons ſomtimes fal into their fits in the very Baths, and ſo are forced to deſiſt from any further uſe of them; or elſe theſe humors being ſcattered and poured abroad are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the other parts, and unto the bowels; and there they cauſe many dangers and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. And ſo we may even very truly conclude, that Baths are more hurtful than helpful unto perſons in this condition, unleſs they obſerve a right and due courſe of dyet, while they make uſe of them.</p>
